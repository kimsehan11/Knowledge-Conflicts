It was first published in 1967 and is considered one of Derrida's most influential works.

The book is a critique of the Western philosophical tradition, particularly the work of Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure. Derrida's analysis of language and writing in Of Grammatology has had a significant impact on various fields, including literary theory, philosophy, and cultural studies.\nAnswer: Jacques Derrida", "[12]\nsource: external, content: The Process: Beat-Era Mysticism and Madness in the Sands of ...: The Process by Brion Gysin is a groundbreaking novel that takes readers on a hallucinatory journey across the Sahara Desert.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Process! by Mike Paton and Lisa González - EOS Worldwide: Process! by Mike Paton and Lisa González | Order Now                                                                                                                                          Skip to content         \r       EOS CONFERENCE 2026 \r     | Nearly Sold Out  BUY TICKETS →            LOGIN                                  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tWHAT IS EOS?\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tFIND AN IMPLEMENTER\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBECOME AN IMPLEMENTER\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tSOFTWARE\t\t\t\t\t\t            \t\t\t\t\t\t\tEOS ACADEMY\t\t\t\t\t\t    Close EOS ACADEMY   Open EOS ACADEMY          COURSES & TRAINING TOOLS & TEMPLATES BOOKS BLOG EVENTS PODCASTS       COURSES & TRAINING TOOLS & TEMPLATES BOOKS BLOG EVENTS PODCASTS                                                                     \t\t\t\t\t\t\tWHAT IS EOS?\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tFIND AN IMPLEMENTER\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBECOME AN IMPLEMENTER\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tSOFTWARE\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tEOS ACADEMY\t\t\t\t\t\t                  Get Started              Get Free Tools                          Run on EOS              Get Free Tools                                       PROCESS!

batteries is lithium itself, specifically lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) or lithium hydroxide (LiOH). These are the primary sources of lithium for battery production. However, the process of extracting lithium from its mineral sources, such as spodumene (LiAlSi2O6) and petalite (LiAlSi4O10), involves several steps including mining, crushing, leaching, and purification. After extraction, the lithium is then used to produce lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which are the key ingredients in the production of lithium-ion batteries.

Rainfall is scarce, with most regions receiving less than 200 mm (8 inches) per year. This harsh climate has shaped the desert's unique ecosystem and the adaptations of its inhabitants.\n\n2. **Geological History**: The Sahara has gone through several wet and dry phases over the past 2.5 million years. During wet periods, the desert was home to lush vegetation and wildlife, while dry periods, like the one we're currently experiencing, have turned it into a vast, barren expanse. This geological history provides valuable insights into climate change and the Earth's natural cycles.\n\n3. **Biodiversity**: Despite its harsh conditions, the Sahara is home to a diverse range of species, including plants like the date palm and animals such as the dromedary camel, the fennec fox, and various species of snakes and lizards. Many of these species have evolved unique adaptations to survive in the desert environment.\n\n4. **Cultural Significance**: The Sahara has been home to numerous civilizations throughout history, including the ancient Egyptians, Nubians, and Berbers. These cultures have left behind artifacts and architectural marvels that provide valuable insights into their way of life. Today, the Sahara continues to influence the cultures and traditions of the people who live on its fringes.\n\n5. **Economic Importance**: The Sahara is rich in natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and minerals like iron, zinc, and phosphate. These resources have attracted significant investment and exploration, making the desert an important economic hub. Additionally, the desert's vast, untapped solar energy potential could play a significant role in the world's transition to renewable energy.\n\n6. **Scientific Research**: The Sahara's unique environment and geological history make it an ideal location for scientific research. Studies conducted in the desert have contributed to our understanding of climate change, evolution, and the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\nIn conclusion, the Sahara Desert's significance lies in its unique climate, geological history, biodiversity, cultural and economic importance, and scientific research potential. It serves as a vital link between Africa and the Middle East, and its future will have significant implications for the region and the world.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Sahara Desert: The Sahara Desert, the world's largest hot desert, is significant in several ways:\n\n1. **Climate and Weather**: The Sahara is characterized by its extreme temperatures, with daytime highs often exceeding 50°C (122°F) and nighttime lows dropping below freezing in some areas.

Some cities and states have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day, while others celebrate both holidays.\n\n[15]\nsource: internal, content: ober Document: It is important to note that Columbus Day is a federal holiday in the United States, but it is not observed in all states. Some states have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day, while others have made Indigenous Peoples' Day an official holiday alongside Columbus Day. This has led to some controversy and debate over the appropriate way to celebrate and honor the history of the Americas.\n\n[16]\nsource: internal, content: ober Document: In addition to Indigenous Peoples' Day and Columbus Day, October is also a month for celebrating Hispanic heritage. National Hispanic Heritage Month is observed from September 15 to October 15 each year. This month-long celebration recognizes the contributions and influence of Hispanic Americans to the United States. While it does not celebrate a specific ethnic group in October alone, Hispanic Heritage Month is an important part of the broader celebration of diversity in America.\n\n[17]\nsource: internal, content: ober Document: To summarize, the ethnic groups that celebrate their contributions to America in October are Native Americans (Indigenous Peoples' Day) and Italian Americans (Columbus Day). Additionally, Hispanic Americans are celebrated during National Hispanic Heritage Month, which overlaps with October. Therefore, while there is no ethnic group that celebrates its contribution to America solely in October, several groups are recognized and honored during this month.\n\n[18]\nsource: internal, content: ober Document: I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous responses. To clarify, the ethnic group that celebrates its contribution to America in October is the Native American community, through Indigenous Peoples' Day. While Columbus Day is also celebrated in October, it is not a celebration of a specific ethnic group's contribution to America. Instead, it commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas and has evolved into a celebration of Italian-American heritage in many parts of the United States.\n\n[19]\nsource: internal, content: ober Document: I would like to add that the movement to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day has gained momentum in recent years. This movement aims to recognize and honor the indigenous peoples of the Americas, rather than celebrating the arrival of Christopher Columbus. Some cities and states have already made this change, while others are considering it.\n\n[20]\nsource: internal, content: ober Document: In response to your question, the ethnic group that celebrates its contribution to America in October is the Native American community, through Indigenous Peoples' Day. This day is an opportunity to honor and recognize the rich histories, cultures, and contributions of Native Americans to the United States.

They can originate only in the Lok Sabha and do not need to be passed by the Rajya Sabha. However, the Rajya Sabha can make recommendations on these bills, which the Lok Sabha can either accept or reject.\n2. Ordinary Bills: These are all other bills that are not Money Bills. They need to be passed by both houses of the Parliament. If a bill is passed by one house and sent to the other, the second house can either pass it, reject it, or amend it and send it back to the first house. If the first house accepts the amendments, the bill becomes a law. If it rejects the amendments, the President can summon a joint session of both houses to resolve the deadlock.\n3. Constitution Amendment Bills: These are bills that seek to amend the Constitution. They also need to be passed by both houses of the Parliament. However, they require a special majority in both houses, which means they need to be passed by a majority of the total number of members of each house present and voting, and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting in each house.\n\nIn summary, for ordinary bills and Constitution Amendment Bills, a simple majority in both houses is required to pass a bill.

The committee then submits its report to the House. The House then debates the Bill and votes on it. If the Bill is passed by a simple majority of members present and voting, it is sent to the other House for consideration. If the other House passes the Bill without any changes, it is sent to the President for assent. If the other House makes changes to the Bill, it is sent back to the original House.

It uses the network protocols to connect to the database. Thin drivers are platform-independent and can be used on any operating system that supports Java.

Examples of thin drivers include the JDBC-ODBC bridge driver and the pure Java drivers provided by some database vendors.\n\n2. **Thick Driver**: Also known as Type", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Eagles' Season Recap: Despite a strong start, the Eagles' 2022-2023 season ended in disappointment.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Core Sovereign Grant**: This is the primary source of income for the British Royal Family. It's funded by taxpayers' money and is a percentage of the Crown Estate's profits. The Crown Estate is a collection of lands and properties owned by the British monarch, but managed by independent trustees. In 2020-21, the Sovereign Grant was £86.3 million.\n\n2. **Private Income**: Some royal families have personal wealth inherited through generations. For instance, the British Royal Family has significant private investments, including art, jewelry, and real estate. However, these are not publicly disclosed and are not part of the Sovereign Grant.\n\n3. **Investment Income**: The Crown Estate generates income from investments in properties, farms, and other assets. In 2020-21, the Crown Estate's total revenue was £344.2 million.\n\n4. **Duchy of Lancaster and Duchy of Cornwall**: These are private estates that generate income for the monarch and the heir to the throne, respectively. The Duchy of Lancaster, which belongs to the monarch, generated £20.2 million in 2020-21. The Duchy of Cornwall, belonging to Prince Charles, generated £22.7 million in 2020-21.\n\n5. **Gifts and Covenants**: Royal families also receive gifts and donations, often from foreign governments or individuals. These are typically used for charitable purposes.\n\n6. **State Visits and Official Engagements**: While not a direct source of income, royal families can generate revenue through state visits and official engagements. For example, they may receive gifts or hospitality from host countries.\n\nHere's a simple breakdown of the British Royal Family's income in 2020-21:\n\n- Sovereign Grant: £86.3 million\n- Duchy of Lancaster: £20.2 million\n- Duchy of Cornwall: £22.7 million\n- Crown Estate (excluding Sovereign Grant): £257.3 million\n- Total: £366.5 million\n\n**I don't know** about the financial details of other royal families around the world, as their sources of income can vary greatly and may not be publicly disclosed.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Royal Finances | The Royal Family: These pages cover the three main sources of funding, namely: the Sovereign Grant, the Privy Purse and The King’s personal wealth and income.\n\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Royal finances | Institute for Government: Royal finances | Institute for Government                                            Skip to main content                                  Sign up to newsletter               Working to make government more effective              Main navigation   About us             Back    About us    Mission        Mission    Vision and values   Our work programme in 2025      Our people        Our people    Directory      Partnerships        Partnerships    Research and engagement   Learning and development   Party conferences      Governance and funding        Governance and funding    Board members   Funding   Annual reports      Careers        Careers    Working at IfG   IfG internship programme   Current vacancies      Media centre        Media centre    IfG in the news   Press releases            Our work             Back    Our work    Topics        Topics    Civil service   Ministers   Public bodies   Public finances   Regulation   Policy making   International relations   Net zero   Devolution   Public services   Procurement   Parliament and the constitution    See all     Research and analysis        Research and analysis    Explainers   Comments   Live blogs   Data   Podcasts   Publications      Trackers        Trackers    Public Services Performance Tracker   Whitehall Monitor            Spotlight on             Back    Spotlight on    IfG Ministers Database   Local and devolved elections 2026   Ministers Reflect         Our publications   Our podcasts             Back    Our podcasts    Inside Briefing   Special podcast series         Our events             Back    Our events    Past events   FAQs about IfG events         IfG Academy             Back    IfG Academy    Ministers and their teams        Ministers and their teams    Support for ministers   Support for private office teams   Support for special advisers   'How-to guides' on being a government minister      Parliamentarians and policy makers        Parliamentarians and policy makers    Support for MPs   Support for civil servants and policy makers   Support for select committees   Support for opposition parties      Engaging with government        Engaging with government    Support for academic researchers   Support for public, private and voluntary sector organisations                About us   Contact us   Privacy   Accessiblility   Careers   Media centre   Partner with us                       Newsletter                                           Working to make government more effective      Search                       Refine search", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: The initial effects of the transition from command to market economies in Eastern Europe, often referred to as 'shock therapy,' were profound and immediate. Here are some key initial effects:\n\n1. **Economic Downturn**: The transition was marked by a significant economic downturn. GDP in many countries dropped dramatically, sometimes by as much as 50% within the first few years. This was due to the closure of unprofitable state-owned enterprises and the restructuring of others.\n\n2. **Increased Poverty and Inequality**: The economic downturn led to a sharp increase in poverty and income inequality. Unemployment rose sharply as state-owned enterprises were privatized and restructured. Those who were able to adapt and find new employment opportunities often did so in the growing private sector, leading to a widening gap between the rich and the poor.\n\n3. **Inflation**: Hyperinflation was a significant issue in many countries. This was often due to the sudden increase in money supply, as well as the removal of price controls. For example, in Russia, inflation reached 2,500% in 1992.\n\n4. **Privatization**: The transition involved a massive privatization of state-owned enterprises. While this was intended to increase efficiency and attract foreign investment, it also led to concerns about 'crony capitalism' and the 'grabbing' of state assets by a few well-connected individuals.\n\n5. **Social Unrest**: The economic and social upheaval led to significant social unrest. Protests and strikes were common, and in some cases, this unrest contributed to political instability and even regime change.\n\n6. **Brain Drain**: The transition also led to a significant brain drain, as many highly skilled individuals left the region in search of better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nWhile these initial effects were challenging, it's important to note that the transition also brought about positive changes, such as increased political and economic freedom, and the eventual recovery and growth of many Eastern European economies. However, the path to recovery was long and difficult, and the initial shock of the transition was severe.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: The transition from a planned to a market economy in Eastern Europe was marked by significant challenges, including a deep recession, rising unemployment, and increased income inequality.

They provide a set of rules and standards that help ensure consistency in formatting, language, and design elements. Here are some values of style guides and style sheets:\n\n1. **Consistency**: Style guides help maintain consistency in the tone, voice, and format of your writing or design. This is particularly important in large organizations or projects where multiple people are contributing to the same document or product.\n\n2. **Time-saving**: By having a set of predefined rules, style guides can save time by eliminating the need to make decisions about formatting and style every time you write or design something.\n\n3. **Quality Control**: Style guides can help catch errors and inconsistencies that might otherwise go unnoticed. They can include rules about grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and more.\n\n4. **Educational**: Style guides can serve as a learning tool, helping new team members understand the organization's or project's specific standards and expectations.\n\n5. **Branding**: For businesses, a well-defined style guide can help maintain a consistent brand image across all communications and materials.\n\nHere are some examples of style guides and style sheets:\n\n- **Writing**: The Chicago Manual of Style, AP Stylebook, and Microsoft's Style Guide are popular choices for written content.\n- **Design**: Adobe's Creative Cloud provides a style sheet feature for maintaining consistent design elements.\n- **Coding**: Google's Material Design Guidelines and Airbnb's Design Language System are examples of coding style guides.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while style guides provide a framework, they should not stifle creativity or flexibility. They should evolve and adapt as needed to reflect changes in language, design trends, or project goals.\n\nIn conclusion, style guides and style sheets are valuable tools for maintaining consistency, saving time, and improving quality in writing, design, and coding projects.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Style Guide and Style Sheet: What Are They?

Here's a simplified version:\n\n1. **Selection**: The first step is to select the right type of stone. The best stones for tool-making are those that are hard, but also have a certain amount of toughness. This allows them to be chipped into sharp edges without breaking. Common types of stone used include flint, quartzite, and basalt.\n\n2. **Preparation**: Once the stone is selected, it needs to be prepared for knapping. This involves removing any imperfections or impurities from the surface. This can be done by rubbing the stone against another stone, or by using a hammerstone to carefully chip away any unwanted material.\n\n3. **Knapping**: This is the process of shaping the stone into a tool. It involves striking the stone with a hammerstone at a specific angle to remove small flakes. The angle and force of the blow can be adjusted to create different types of flakes, which can then be used to shape the tool further.\n\n4. **Retouching**: After the basic shape of the tool has been created, it may need to be retouched. This involves removing small flakes from the edges to create a sharp, smooth edge. This step can also be used to create notches or other features in the tool.\n\n5. **Testing**: Finally, the tool needs to be tested to ensure it works as intended. This can involve using it to cut, scrape, or pierce something, or simply checking the sharpness of the edge.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Stone Age Tool Making Techniques - Ancient History Encyclopedia: The process of making stone tools involves several steps.

Regeneration is the process by which damaged cells, tissues, or organs are replaced or repaired. This can occur naturally in many organisms, including humans, although the extent and type of regeneration varies greatly among species. For example, salamanders are known for their remarkable ability to regenerate entire limbs, while humans can only regenerate certain types of cells and tissues, such as skin and liver cells. In the context of medicine, regenerative medicine is a field of research that aims to harness this natural ability to repair or replace damaged or diseased tissues and organs. However, it's important to note that while regeneration is a powerful process, it's not always possible or effective, and sometimes, surgical intervention or other treatments may be necessary.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Tissue repair: The hidden drama - PMC: True regeneration, in which new cells replace damaged or dead cells such that the tissue is restored to its original state, occurs infrequently in humans.\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Tissue repair Definition and Examples - Biology Online Dictionary: Tissue repair Definition and Examples - Biology Online Dictionary                        Skip to content   Main Navigation           Search         Dictionary Articles Tutorials                     Dictionary > Tissue repair Tissue repair    Definition noun The process of restoring the structural and physiological integrity after an injury Supplement Tissue repair is a natural process in which the primary goal is to restore the structure and function of the tissue following an injury.\n[15]\nsource: external, content: Tissue Regeneration: What It Is & More | Net Health: At its core, tissue regeneration involves the repair and replacement of damaged or diseased tissues, a vital aspect of regenerative medicine.\n[16]\nsource: external, content: Immunoregulatory and Regenerative Therapy – MedRegen LLC: Fibrosis, better known as scar formation is the end result of repair.\n[17]\nsource: external, content: Wound healing – regeneration and scarring - Pathologia: Regeneration – restoration of the damaged tissues; Healing by scarring – repair where complete restoration and recapitulation of normality is not possible ...\n[18]\nsource: external, content: Regeneration | National Institute of General Medical Sciences - NIH: Regeneration is the process of replacing or restoring damaged or missing cells, tissues, organs, and even entire body parts to full function.\n[19]\nsource: external, content: Healing and repair - Clinical GateClinical Gate: Regeneration is the replacement of dead cells by an exactly similar cell population, so that the anatomy returns to normal.\n[20]\nsource: external, content: Tissue repair Definition and Examples - Biology Online Dictionary: Tissue repair Definition and Examples - Biology Online Dictionary                        Skip to content   Main Navigation           Search         Dictionary Articles Tutorials                     Dictionary > Tissue repair Tissue repair    Definition noun The process of restoring the structural and physiological integrity after an injury Supplement Tissue repair is a natural process in which the primary goal is to restore the structure and function of the tissue following an injury.\n[21]\nsource: external, content: Tissue Injury and Aging | Anatomy and Physiology I - Lumen Learning: Regeneration is the addition of new cells of the same type as the ones that were injured (Figure 1).\n\nAnalysis:\nThe term that describes the replacement of damaged cells to mend a tissue is 'regeneration'.

By the mid-19th century, the British had established control over the entire continent, with the exception of the Northern Territory, which was not fully under British control until the 1911 Northern Territory Acceptance Act. Additionally, the British also controlled New Zealand, which was annexed in 1840, and later, in the late 19th century, they established control over the island of Fiji. However, it is important to note that while the British had political and military control over these territories, they did not have complete cultural or economic control over the indigenous populations.

This observation was first made by Lawrence W. Morley in 1963, who noticed that the magnetic stripes on the ocean floor were symmetrical and aligned with the mid-ocean ridges. This observation provided strong evidence for the theory of seafloor spreading, as it showed that the oceanic crust was moving away from the mid-ocean ridges and cooling, causing the magnetic minerals in the crust to align with the Earth's magnetic field at the time of their formation. This process of magnetic stripe formation continues today, providing ongoing evidence for the theory of seafloor spreading.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Seafloor Spreading - National Geographic Education: The theory of seafloor spreading was first proposed by Harry Hess in 1960 and further developed by Robert Dietz in 1961. The key observation that led to this theory was the discovery of the mid-ocean ridge system, a vast underwater mountain range that runs through the world's oceans. This ridge system is characterized by high volcanic activity and is where new oceanic crust is formed. The theory of seafloor spreading explains how the oceanic crust moves away from the mid-ocean ridges, cools, and eventually sinks back into the mantle at the trenches. This process, known as the 'conveyor belt' model, is driven by the movement of tectonic plates. The theory of seafloor spreading has been widely accepted and supported by numerous observations and experiments, including the detection of magnetic stripes on the ocean floor, which align with the mid-ocean ridges. These stripes are formed by the periodic reversals of Earth's magnetic field, providing evidence for the continuous creation and movement of oceanic crust.\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Seafloor Spreading - National Geographic Education: The theory of seafloor spreading was first proposed by Harry Hess in 1960 and further developed by Robert Dietz in 1961.

Control of this area could provide a route for Union forces to invade the Confederate state of Virginia.\n\n2. **Union Victory**: The battle resulted in a Union victory, led by General William Rosecrans. Although the Confederates, under General John B. Floyd, initially held the high ground, Rosecrans' forces were able to dislodge them, securing the area for the Union.\n\n3. **Boosted Union Morale**: The victory at Carnifex Ferry was one of the first significant Union victories in the Civil War's Western Theater. It boosted the morale of Union troops and demonstrated their capability to challenge Confederate forces.\n\n4. **Ended Floyd's Command**: The defeat at Carnifex Ferry led to the removal of General Floyd from his command. He was later court-martialed for his actions during the battle.\n\n5. **Impact on the Kanawha Valley Campaign**: The battle was part of the larger Kanawha Valley Campaign. Union control of Carnifex Ferry allowed them to continue their advance into the valley, ultimately leading to the Union's capture of Gauley Bridge and Summersville.\n\nIn conclusion, the Battle of Carnifex Ferry was important due to its strategic location, the morale boost it provided to Union forces, the removal of General Floyd from his command, and its impact on the broader Kanawha Valley Campaign.\n\n[22]\nsource: external, content: Battle of Carnifex Ferry - Wikipedia: The battle resulted in a Union strategic victory that contributed to the eventual Confederate withdrawal from western Virginia, which in turn led to the creation of the State of West Virginia two years later.\n\n[23]\nsource: external, content: Battle of Carnifex Ferry - e-WV: In July 1861, Union forces pushed the Confederates out of the Kanawha Valley and occupied the strategic Gauley Bridge area.\n\n[24]\nsource: external, content: The Battle of Carnifex Ferry | Civil War West Virginia - YouTube: On September 10, 1861, Union and Confederate forces clashed high above the Gauley River in Virginia (today West Virginia).

His relationships evolve and change throughout the series, reflecting the tumultuous nature of teenage life and the show's exploration of complex human dynamics. Thus, I don't know who Tony 'ends up' with in the traditional sense, as his relationships are fluid and multifaceted.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[15]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[16]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[17]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[18]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[19]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[20]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[21]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[22]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[23]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[24]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[25]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[26]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[27]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[28]\nsource: external, content: Skins - Character Analysis: Tony Stonem - Animus - Wattpad: The best conversation to really understand the mind of Tony Stonem is the one he has with Sid outside Effy's hospital room.\n[29", "[12]\nsource: external, content: Depeche Mode - Lead Singer: Dave Gahan is the lead singer of Depeche Mode.

If the President is removed from office through impeachment, the Vice President takes over as President. Here's a simplified breakdown:\n\n1. **Impeachment**: The House of Representatives has the sole power of impeachment. If a simple majority votes to impeach the President, the Senate then holds a trial to decide whether to remove the President from office. A two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for removal.\n\n2. **Removal**: If the Senate votes to remove the President, the Vice President becomes the new President. This is explicitly stated in Section 1 of the 25th Amendment: In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.\n\n3. **Succession**: If the Vice President is also removed, resigns, or is unable to serve, the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 comes into play. This act establishes the order of succession, which currently is: Speaker of the House, President pro tempore of the Senate, Secretary of State, and other members of the Cabinet in the order they were created.\n\nSo, to answer your question, when the President is impeached and removed from office, the Vice President becomes the new President.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Frequently Asked ...: How is a vice-presidential vacancy filled?

Here's a breakdown of its purpose:\n\n1. **Temporary Funding**: A CR provides temporary funding for federal agencies and programs, usually until a new appropriations bill is passed or a new fiscal year begins. It's essentially a stopgap measure to prevent a government shutdown.\n\n2. **Maintaining Operations**: The primary purpose of a CR is to maintain government operations and services at existing levels. It doesn't provide new funding or authorize new programs. Instead, it extends the funding for ongoing activities.\n\n3. **Avoiding Shutdowns**: Without a CR or a full-year appropriations bill, the government would shut down, as it did in 2018 and 2019. A CR helps avoid these disruptions by keeping the government running.\n\n4. **Time Extension**: CRs are typically short-term solutions, lasting anywhere from a few days to a few months. They are often used when Congress and the President cannot agree on a full-year spending bill before the start of the fiscal year (October 1st).\n\nHere's a simple example: If Congress hasn't passed all 12 appropriations bills by October 1st, a CR might be passed to fund the government at current levels until those bills are completed.\n\nIn summary, the purpose of a continuing resolution is to temporarily fund the government to avoid a shutdown while Congress works to pass full-year appropriations bills.\nLast Context: [12]\nQuestion: What are the key details of a continuing resolution?\nNew Context:\n[13]\nsource: external, content: What is a Continuing Resolution? - National Conference of State Legislatures: A continuing resolution (CR) is a temporary spending measure used by Congress to keep the government funded when the regular appropriations process has not been completed.

They are often used when Congress and the President cannot agree on a full-year spending bill before the start of the fiscal year (October 1st).\n\n5. **Funding Levels**: CRs often fund agencies and programs at the same levels as the previous year. However, they can also include adjustments to reflect changes in program needs or priorities.\n\n6. **Policy Riders**: CRs can include policy riders, which are provisions that have nothing to do with spending. These can be controversial and can lead to disputes between Congress and the President.\n\nHere's a simple example: If Congress hasn't passed all 12 appropriations bills by October 1st, a CR might be passed to fund the government at current levels until those bills are completed. The CR might also include policy riders that reflect the priorities of the majority party in Congress.\n\nLast Context: [13]\nQuestion: How does a continuing resolution impact government operations?\nNew Context:\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Continuing Resolutions: Impact on Federal Operations - GAO: Continuing resolutions (CRs) can have significant impacts on federal operations. Here's how:\n\n1. **Disruption of Normal Operations**: CRs disrupt the normal budget process and can lead to uncertainty about funding levels. This can make it difficult for agencies to plan and implement programs.\n\n2. **Delayed Program Implementation**: CRs can delay the implementation of new programs or initiatives. This is because they often fund agencies at the same levels as the previous year, without providing new funding for new activities.\n\n3. **Impact on Contracting**: CRs can affect federal contracting. They can delay the award of new contracts or the renewal of existing ones. This can lead to disruptions in services and increased costs.\n\n4. **Impact on Hiring**: CRs can also affect federal hiring. They can delay the hiring of new employees or the filling of vacant positions. This can lead to staffing shortages and increased workloads for existing employees.\n\n5. **Impact on Grants**: CRs can affect the award of grants. They can delay the announcement of new grant competitions or the award of grants to eligible applicants.\n\n6. **Impact", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Document: Half-Life 2: Episode Two is the second episode in the Half-Life 2 series, developed by Valve Corporation.

It agreed that British debts incurred before the war would be paid, and that American claims for property lost during the war would be considered.\n\n4. **Allowed for Extradition**: The treaty allowed for the extradition of criminals who fled from one country to another. This helped maintain international order and cooperation.\n\n5. **Promoted Trade**: The treaty facilitated trade between the U.S. and Britain, allowing for the exchange of goods and ideas that fostered economic growth.\n\nIn summary, the Treaty of Paris was instrumental in establishing the United States as a sovereign nation, defining its territorial boundaries, and setting the stage for its economic and political development.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Treaty of Paris, 1783 - state.gov: Based on a 1782 preliminary treaty, the agreement recognized U.\n\n[14]\nsource: external, content: The Treaty of Paris: America's Future on the Brink: Select your\r                                     Registration\r                                         \r                                             $25\r                                          \r                                             Member\r                                               \r                                             $30\r                                          \r                                             Non-Member\r                                                    \r                     Resize text\r                             Signed in November 1783, the Treaty of Paris was the formal agreement that ended the War for Independence and created the United States of America.\n\n[15]\nsource: external, content: The Treaty of Paris, 1783 | Benjamin Franklin | A Film by Ken Burns: The American Revolutionary War was over, and Britain officially recognized the independent United States of America and its claims to a ...\n\n[16]\nsource: external, content: Treaty of Paris - Definition, Date & Terms - History.com: In the Treaty of Paris, the British Crown formally recognized American independence and ceded most of its territory east of the Mississippi River to the United States, doubling the size of the new nation and paving the way for westward expansion.\n\n[17]\nsource: external, content: The Treaty of Paris: Negotiating from Weakness - The Strategy Bridge: The treaty set the precedent for American negotiators to operate from a position of military weakness, until the 1840s.\n\n[18]\nsource: external, content: The Treaty of Paris, 1783 - Benjamin Franklin - PBS: PBS America @ 250FoodHistoryHome & How-ToNews & Public AffairsScience & NatureShowsMy ListDonateSign InThe Treaty of Paris, 1783Clip | 4m 20sVideo has Closed Captions | CCThe Treaty of Paris ended a war, secured Independence and created an Empire.\n\n[19]\nsource: external, content: Ratification of the Treaty of Paris - Maryland State Archives: The Treaty formally ended the Revolutionary War and\r \t\t\testablished the United States as a free and independent nation.\n\n[20]\nsource: internal, content: treaty of paris do for the united states Document: The Treaty of Paris, signed on September 3, 1783, officially ended the American Revolutionary War between the United States and Great Britain.

From the provided documents, we have consistent information from both internal and external sources that the first case of Alzheimer's was diagnosed in 1906 by Dr. Alois Alzheimer. This information is consistent across documents [11, 13, 14, 15, 17].\n\nHowever, document [16] provides conflicting information.

This is consistent with information from documents [11, 13, 14, 15, 17].

The show stars Kevin James as a retired police officer turned security guard, Kevin Gable, who is trying to balance his family life with his new job. The show's title is a play on the phrase Kevin can wait, which is often used to indicate that someone is not in a hurry.\n\nIn the show's first season, Kevin's wife, Donna (played by Erinn Hayes), is a recurring character. However, in the second season, it is revealed that Donna has left the show. This was due to a decision made by the show's producers to change the show's format and focus more on Kevin's relationship with his co-worker, Vanessa (played by Leah Remini).\n\nThe decision to remove Donna from the show was not well-received by some fans of the series, who felt that the show's dynamic had changed significantly with her absence. However, the show's producers stood by their decision, stating that they wanted to take the show in a new direction and explore different storylines.\n\nIn an interview, Kevin James discussed the decision to remove Donna from the show, saying, It was a tough decision, but we felt like we needed to shake things up and try something new.

It is estimated that it killed up to 60% of the English population. The pandemic gradually declined in 1350, but it did not completely disappear. Recurrences of the plague occurred in England in 1361, 1369, 1375, and 1389. The last major outbreak in England was in 1665-1666, known as the Great Plague of London.

It is derived from the Middle English word 'robberd', which was an occupational name for a 'robber' or 'robber baron'. The term 'robber' originally referred to a 'robber' or 'plunderer', but it also had a more positive connotation, referring to a 'strong' or 'powerful' person. The name was likely given to someone who was considered strong or powerful, or perhaps to someone who was a leader or a warrior.

The election is conducted by secret ballot, with MPs voting for their preferred candidate. The candidate with the most votes is elected as Speaker.

It involves the surgical removal or disconnection of one entire cerebral hemisphere, which is one of the two halves of the brain that control voluntary movement, sensation, and cognition. This procedure is typically performed as a last resort when other treatments have failed to control the seizures.\nLast Context: None\nQuestion: What is the purpose of a hemispherectomy?\nNew Context:\n[13]\nsource: internal, content: , explicitly state ’I don’t know’ to avoid any hallucinations.\nQuestion: What are the risks associated with a hemispherectomy?\nDocument: The risks associated with a hemispherectomy include infection, bleeding, stroke, and death. Additionally, the procedure carries the risk of cognitive and motor deficits, as well as the potential for persistent seizures. The likelihood of these risks varies depending on the individual patient's health and the specific surgical approach used.\nLast Context: None\nQuestion: What are the risks associated with a hemispherectomy?\nNew Context:\n[14]\nsource: internal, content: , explicitly state ’I don’t know’ to avoid any hallucinations.\nQuestion: What is the recovery process like after a hemispherectomy?\nDocument: The recovery process after a hemispherectomy is typically long and involves several stages. Initially, the patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for any complications. Once stable, the patient will be transferred to a regular hospital room for further recovery. Physical therapy and rehabilitation are often necessary to help the patient regain lost motor skills and cognitive function. The recovery process can take several months to a year or more, and some patients may experience ongoing cognitive or motor deficits.\nLast Context: None\nQuestion: What is the recovery process like after a hemispherectomy?\nNew Context:\n[15]\nsource: internal, content: , explicitly state ’I don’t know’ to avoid any hallucinations.\nQuestion: What is the success rate of a hemispherectomy in treating epilepsy?\nDocument: The success rate of a hemispherectomy in treating epilepsy varies depending on the specific case and the definition of success used. However, studies have shown that approximately 60-80% of patients who undergo a hemispherectomy experience a significant reduction in seizure frequency, with about half of these patients becoming completely seizure-free. The procedure is typically considered successful if the patient experiences a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency.\nLast Context: None\nQuestion: What is the success rate of a hemispherectomy in treating epilepsy?\nNew Context:\n[16]\nsource: internal, content: , explicitly state ’I don’t know’ to avoid any hallucinations.\nQuestion: What is the typical age range for patients undergoing a hemispherectomy?\nDocument: The typical age range for patients undergoing a hemispherectomy is between 1 and 30 years old. However, the procedure can be performed at any age if medically necessary. Most patients who undergo a hemispherectomy are children or young adults with severe, drug-resistant epilepsy.\nLast Context: None\nQuestion: What is the typical age range for patients undergoing a hemispherectomy?\nNew Context:\n[17]\nsource: internal, content: , explicitly state ’I don’t know’ to avoid any hallucinations.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a functional hemispherectomy and an anatomical hemispherectomy?\nDocument: There are two main types of hemispherectomy: functional and anatomical. A functional hemispherectomy involves disconnecting the diseased hemisphere from the rest of the brain, while leaving the majority of the cerebral tissue intact. This approach is often used when the seizures are localized to one area of the brain. An anatomical hemispherectomy, on the other hand, involves the complete removal of the diseased hemisphere. This approach is typically used when the seizures are widespread throughout the hemisphere.\nLast Context: None\nQuestion: What is the difference between a functional hemispherectomy and an anatomical hemispherectomy?\nNew Context:\n[18]\nsource: internal, content: , explicitly state ’I don’t know’ to avoid any hallucinations.\nQuestion: What is the role of a hemispherectomy in the treatment of epilepsy?\nDocument: A hemispherectomy plays a role in the treatment of epilepsy when other treatments, such as medication and less invasive surgeries, have failed to control the seizures. It is typically considered a last resort due to the significant risks and potential side effects associated with the procedure. However, for patients with severe, drug-resistant epilepsy, a hemispherectomy can be life-changing, offering the potential for significant reduction or even elimination of seizures.\nLast Context: None\nQuestion: What is the role of a hemispherectomy in the treatment of epilepsy?\nNew Context:\n[19]\nsource: internal, content: , explicitly state ’I don’t know’ to avoid any hallucinations.\nQuestion: What is the typical surgical approach for a hemispherectomy?\nDocument: The typical surgical", "[12]\nsource: external, content: Wang River - Wikipedia: The Wang River is a river in Thailand.

Document: After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the capital of Russia was moved back to Moscow. This move was part of the Bolsheviks' efforts to distance themselves from the old regime and establish a new center of power. The move was completed in 1918, and Moscow has remained the capital of Russia ever since.\n[13]\nsource: internal, content: Why did Peter the Great move the capital from Moscow to Saint Petersburg? Document: Peter the Great moved the capital from Moscow to Saint Petersburg in order to establish a new capital that would serve as a 'window to Europe.' He wanted to modernize Russia and bring it closer to Western Europe, and he believed that Saint Petersburg, with its strategic location on the Baltic Sea, would be an ideal location for this purpose.\n[14]\nsource: internal, content: What was the original name of Saint Petersburg? Document: The original name of Saint Petersburg was Petrograd. The name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd in 1914, during World War I, to remove any German-sounding names from the city.

Document: The ASPH (aspartate beta-hydroxylase) gene in humans is located on chromosome 12 and is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins. It encodes for two protein isoforms, ASPH and ASPH-like (ASPHL), which are generated by alternative splicing of the mRNA transcript. Here's a brief description of each:\n\n1. **ASPH (Aspartate beta-hydroxylase)**: This is the full-length isoform, consisting of 352 amino acids. It contains a signal peptide at the N-terminus, indicating that it is targeted for secretion. ASPH plays a crucial role in the hydroxylation of aspartic acid residues in proteins, a process essential for the proper folding and function of many proteins, including Notch receptors and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).\n\n2. **ASPHL (ASPH-like)**: This isoform, also known as ASPHD2, is generated by the exclusion of exon 2 from the mRNA transcript. It consists of 314 amino acids and lacks the signal peptide present in ASPH. Consequently, ASPHL is not secreted and remains in the cytoplasm. Despite its name, ASPHL does not possess aspartate beta-hydroxylase activity. Instead, it has been shown to interact with other proteins and may play a role in regulating their activity or localization.\n\nIn summary, the ASPH gene in humans encodes for two protein isoforms: ASPH, which is a functional aspartate beta-hydroxylase, and ASPHL, which lacks enzymatic activity but may have other regulatory roles.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: ASPH protein expression summary: ASPH (BAH, CASQ2BP1, HAAH, JCTN)   Protein classi   Assigned HPA protein class(es) for the encoded protein(s).\n\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Diverse molecular functions of aspartate β-hydroxylase in cancer: Via alternative splicing and exon sharing, the gene encodes four functionally distinct proteins: AspH, humbug, junctin and junctate (3,10).\n\n[15]\nsource: external, content: Aspartate beta hydroxylase (ASPH) (NM_032466) Human ...: 3   RefSeq Size 2680   RefSeq ORF 939   Synonyms AAH; BAH; CASQ2BP1; FDLAB; HAAH; JCTN; junctin   Summary This gene is thought to play an important role in calcium homeostasis.\n\n[16]\nsource: external, content: ASPH Gene - Ma'ayan Lab – Computational Systems Biology: ASPH hydroxylates aspartate and asparagine residues within epidermal growth factor–like domains, and its re‐expression is associated with oncogenic signaling.\n\n[17]\nsource: external, content: ASPH - aspartate beta-hydroxylase - Sigma-Aldrich: The longest isoforms (a and f) include a C-terminal Aspartyl/Asparaginyl beta-hydroxylase domain that hydroxylates aspartic acid or asparagine residues in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of some proteins, including protein C, coagulation factors VII, IX, and X, and the complement factors C1R and C1S.\n\n[18]\nsource: external, content: Human Gene ASPH (ENST00000379454.9) from GENCODE V49: TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Isoform 1 is detected in all tissues tested.

It is characterized by the overproduction of mature B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.\n\nSomatic mutations are changes that occur in the DNA of individual cells, rather than in the DNA that is passed down from parents. In CLL, several genes are more frequently affected by somatic mutations. Here are some of the most commonly affected genes:\n\n1. **TP53**: This gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a critical role in cell division, DNA repair, and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Mutations in TP53 are associated with disease progression and poor prognosis in CLL.\n\n2. **NOTCH1**: NOTCH1 is a receptor protein that plays a role in cell communication. Mutations in NOTCH1 are found in about 10-15% of CLL cases and are associated with an aggressive form of the disease.\n\n3. **SF3B1**: SF3B1 is a gene involved in RNA splicing. Mutations in SF3B1 are found in about 10-15% of CLL cases and are associated with a more indolent (slow-growing) form of the disease.\n\n4. **ATM**: ATM is a protein kinase that plays a role in repairing damaged DNA. Mutations in ATM are found in about 5-10% of CLL cases and are associated with a poor prognosis.\n\n5. **BIRC3**: BIRC3 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in inhibiting apoptosis. Mutations in BIRC3 are found in about 5-10% of CLL cases and are associated with an aggressive form of the disease.\n\nWhile these genes are more frequently affected by somatic mutations in CLL, it's important to note that not all CLL cases will have mutations in these genes, and the presence or absence of these mutations can influence the prognosis and treatment of the disease.\n\nI don’t know: The specific frequency of somatic mutations in these genes can vary depending on the study and the population, so I can’t provide an exact percentage. Also, I don’t have real-time or future information, so I can’t predict how these frequencies might change over time.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: The most commonly mutated genes in CLL are NOTCH1, SF3B1, TP53, and BIRC3, which are mutated in approximately 10-15% of cases each.

Document: Top-down mass spectrometric analysis of histones offers several advantages:\n\n1. **Preservation of Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs)**: In top-down analysis, the histone proteins are analyzed intact, allowing for the preservation of all PTMs. This is crucial as PTMs play a significant role in regulating gene expression and chromatin structure.\n\n2. **Identification of PTM Combinations**: Top-down analysis can identify the combinations of PTMs on a single histone molecule. This is not possible with bottom-up approaches, which fragment the proteins into peptides, losing the context of PTM combinations.\n\n3. **Quantification of PTMs**: Top-down analysis allows for the quantification of PTMs, providing information about the stoichiometry of modifications on histone proteins. This can help understand the dynamics of PTM regulation.\n\n4. **High-Throughput Capability**: Modern top-down mass spectrometry techniques, such as those using ion mobility, can analyze multiple histone variants and their PTMs simultaneously, making it a high-throughput method.\n\n5. **Minimal Sample Preparation**: Top-down analysis requires minimal sample preparation, making it a faster and more straightforward process compared to bottom-up approaches.\n\n6. **Direct Comparison with Theoretical Predictions**: Top-down analysis provides direct mass measurements of intact proteins, allowing for direct comparison with theoretical predictions, which can aid in protein identification and validation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that top-down analysis also has its challenges, such as the complexity of histone protein sequences and the need for high-resolution mass spectrometers. Despite these challenges, the advantages make top-down mass spectrometric analysis a powerful tool for studying histone proteins and their PTMs.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Top-Down Mass Spectrometry for Protein Identification and Characterization: Top-down mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful technique for protein identification and characterization.

The exact cause of Katayama Fever is not fully understood, but it is believed to be associated with an allergic reaction to certain parasites, particularly the roundworm Anisakis simplex, which is often found in raw or undercooked fish. Here's a breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Ingestion of Parasite**: The infection typically occurs when a person consumes raw or undercooked fish that contains the larvae of the Anisakis simplex parasite.\n\n2. **Allergic Reaction**: The body's immune system responds to the parasite by producing antibodies and eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. This reaction is similar to that seen in other allergic responses.\n\n3. **Inflammation**: The eosinophils migrate to the small intestine, causing inflammation and damage to the intestinal lining. This leads to the symptoms of Katayama Fever.\n\nWhile Anisakis simplex is the most commonly associated parasite, other parasites like Anisakidae and Pseudoterranova decipiens have also been linked to Katayama Fever. It's important to note that not everyone who ingests these parasites develops Katayama Fever, suggesting that individual immune responses may play a role in the onset of the disease.\n\n**Symptoms**: Katayama Fever typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and eosinophilia (an elevated number of eosinophils in the blood).\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment**: Diagnosis is usually based on the patient's history of consuming raw or undercooked fish, along with the presence of symptoms. Treatment involves supportive care, such as managing symptoms with antidiarrheal medications and ensuring adequate hydration. In severe cases, corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation.\n\n**Prevention**: To prevent Katayama Fever, it's crucial to avoid consuming raw or undercooked fish. If you choose to eat fish, ensure it's thoroughly cooked to kill any parasites.\n\n**I don’t know**: While Katayama Fever is associated with certain parasites, the exact mechanism by which they cause the disease is not fully understood.

Here are some of the most common methods:\n\n1. **Ranking by Association**: This method prioritizes genes based on their association with the disease. It uses data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or other genetic association studies. The genes with the strongest association signals are ranked higher.\n\n2. **Functional Enrichment Analysis**: This method uses gene ontology (GO) terms or pathway information to prioritize genes. It assumes that disease-related genes are likely to be involved in similar biological processes or pathways. Genes that are part of significantly enriched GO terms or pathways are ranked higher.\n\n3. **Network Analysis**: This method uses protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks or gene co-expression networks to prioritize genes. It assumes that disease-related genes are likely to be connected to each other in the network. Genes that are central in the network or have many connections are ranked higher.\n\n4. **Machine Learning Approaches**: These methods use machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from large datasets and predict the disease relevance of genes. They can incorporate various types of data, such as genetic association, functional annotation, and network analysis. Examples include Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.\n\n5. **Integrative Methods**: These methods combine multiple approaches to prioritize genes. They often use a scoring system that integrates information from different methods. This can help to reduce the bias of individual methods and improve the overall accuracy of gene prioritization.\n\nEach of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method often depends on the specific disease and the available data. Some methods may be more suitable for certain types of diseases or datasets than others.\n\nI don’t know: While these methods are widely used and have been shown to be effective in many studies, I don’t know how well they would perform in every possible scenario.

This can be achieved through several methods, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here are some of the most common methods:\n\n1. **Recombinant DNA Technology**: This involves cutting DNA at specific points using restriction enzymes, then joining the fragments together using DNA ligase. This method allows for the insertion of specific genes into a cell.\n\n2. **Transfection**: This method uses chemicals or physical means to introduce foreign DNA into cells. It's commonly used in vitro (in the lab) and can be efficient, but it's often temporary and may not integrate into the host cell's genome.\n\n3. **Gene Editing**: This is a more precise method that uses tools like CRISPR-Cas9 to target and modify specific genes. It allows for the addition, deletion, or alteration of DNA sequences.\n\n4. **Retroviruses and other Viral Vectors**: These are viruses that have been modified to carry and deliver specific genes into cells. They can integrate their genetic material into the host cell's DNA, providing a stable method for gene transfer.\n\n5. **Microinjection**: This involves physically injecting DNA into a cell using a very fine needle. It's highly efficient but also invasive and labor-intensive.\n\n6. **Electroporation**: This uses an electrical pulse to temporarily create pores in the cell membrane, allowing DNA to enter the cell. It's simple and efficient but may not be suitable for all cell types.\n\n7. **Lipofection**: This uses lipids to encapsulate DNA, helping it to fuse with the cell membrane and enter the cell. It's non-invasive and can be used with a wide range of cell types.\n\n8. **Gene Silencing**: This involves using RNA interference (RNAi) to block the expression of specific genes. It's often used to study gene function and can also be used in gene therapy.\n\n9. **Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs)**: These are engineered proteins that can cut DNA at specific locations. They're similar to CRISPR-Cas9 but were developed earlier and are less commonly used today.\n\n10. **Transposon-Mediated Transgenesis**: This involves using transposable elements (like Sleeping Beauty or PiggyBac) to insert genes into the host cell's genome. It's efficient and can be used to create stable cell lines.\n\nEach of these methods has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of method depends on the specific goals of the research or therapy.", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: LY450139 is investigational name of which drug?

Therefore, Mitofilin is a part of the MICOS complex, but it does not form a complex solely with these proteins; rather,", "[1]\nsource: external, content: Stroke Prognostication using Age and NIH Stroke Scale: SPAN-100: Individuals whose age in years plus NIHSS score was greater than or equal to 100 are designated as SPAN-100–positive patients, while those with a score <100 are designated as SPAN-100–negative.\n\n[2]\nsource: external, content: Modified SPAN-100 index in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage: It is the sum of age and baseline NIHSS dichotomized into scores greater or less than 100, such that scores >100 had poorer prognosis.\n\n[3]\nsource: external, content: [PDF] Using the full span of the SPAN100 index to predict functional ...: We aimed to study the rela- tionship of SPAN-100 index as a continu- ous variable with functional outcomes measured by the modified Rankin score.

decrease in the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds and cushions the brain and spinal cord. This can happen due to conditions that cause excessive loss of CSF, such as spinal leaks or lumbar puncture, or due to conditions that decrease the production of CSF, such as certain medications or illnesses.\n\nThe definitive treatment for low pressure headache depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the headache. Here are some common treatment options:\n\n1. **Bed Rest and Hydration**: In mild cases, bed rest and increased fluid intake may be sufficient to help the body reabsorb the lost CSF and relieve the headache.\n\n2. **Caffeine**: Caffeine can help to constrict blood vessels in the brain, which can reduce the headache. It can be taken orally or intravenously.\n\n3. **Pain Medications**: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, or prescription pain medications, may be used to manage the headache.\n\n4. **Epidural Blood Patch (EBP)**: This is a procedure where a small amount of the patient's own blood is injected into the epidural space in the spine. The blood clots and seals the leak, increasing the CSF pressure and relieving the headache. EBP is often the definitive treatment for spinal leaks.\n\n5. **Surgical Repair**: In some cases, if a leak is caused by a tear or hole in the dura (the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord), surgery may be necessary to repair the leak.\n\n6. **Intrathecal Blood Patch**: Similar to an epidural blood patch, but the blood is injected into the subarachnoid space (the space between the arachnoid and pia mater layers of the meninges). This is typically used when an epidural blood patch is not effective.\n\n7. **CSF Volume Replacement**: In some cases, a small amount of artificial CSF may be injected to replace the lost fluid and increase the CSF pressure.\n\nIt's important to note that the treatment should be tailored to the individual patient based on their specific condition and the severity of their symptoms. Always consult with a healthcare provider for advice.\n\nI don’t know: While these are the common treatments for low pressure headache, I don’t know the specific treatment that would be best for you without knowing your medical history and the exact cause of your headache.

The treatment of T3 toxicosis typically involves a combination of the following approaches:\n\n1. **Antithyroid Medications**: These drugs, such as methimazole or propylthiouracil, inhibit the production of thyroid hormones. They are often used as a first-line treatment to reduce the amount of thyroid hormone in the body.\n\n2. **Beta-Blockers**: These medications, like propranolol, block the effects of thyroid hormones on the body's beta receptors. They can provide rapid relief from symptoms such as tremors, anxiety, and rapid heart rate.\n\n3. **Iodine**: In some cases, iodine may be used to treat T3 toxicosis. Iodine can inhibit the release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. However, it should be used with caution, as it can also stimulate thyroid hormone production in some individuals.\n\n4. **Thyroidectomy**: In severe cases or when medical treatment is not effective, surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) may be recommended. This is usually done when the cause of the toxicosis is a nodule or a goiter.\n\n5. **Radioactive Iodine (RAI) Therapy**: This treatment involves ingesting a radioactive form of iodine, which is then taken up by the thyroid gland and destroys the thyroid tissue that is producing excess hormones. This is often used when the cause of the toxicosis is an overactive thyroid gland.\n\nThe choice of treatment depends on various factors, including the severity of the condition, the underlying cause, and individual patient factors. It's crucial to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for each individual case.\n\nI don’t know: While I can provide general information about the treatment of T3 toxicosis, I don’t have access to individual patient records or medical expertise.

It is characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and cardiovascular problems. Among other features, WS is also associated with certain hormonal abnormalities.\n\n1. **Thyroid Hormone Abnormalities**: One of the most common hormonal abnormalities in WS is an underactive thyroid, also known as hypothyroidism. This is due to the deletion of the gene that encodes for the enzyme needed to produce thyroid hormones. As a result, individuals with WS may have low levels of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) and high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.\n\n2. **Growth Hormone Abnormalities**: Growth hormone (GH) deficiency is also common in WS. This is thought to be due to the deletion of the gene that encodes for the GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor. GH deficiency can result in short stature and delayed puberty in individuals with WS.\n\n3. **Adrenal Gland Abnormalities**: Some individuals with WS may have abnormalities in their adrenal glands, which produce hormones like cortisol and aldosterone. These abnormalities can lead to conditions such as Addison's disease (cortisol deficiency) or Conn's syndrome (aldosterone excess).\n\n4. **Sexual Maturation**: The age at which individuals with WS reach sexual maturity can be delayed. This is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including growth hormone deficiency and thyroid dysfunction.\n\nIt's important to note that hormonal abnormalities in WS can vary greatly from one individual to another. Therefore, regular monitoring and management of hormone levels are crucial for individuals with WS to maintain optimal health and development.\n\n**I don’t know**: While WS is associated with these hormonal abnormalities, the specific cause and extent of these abnormalities can vary and may not be fully understood in all cases. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details about less common or unknown hormonal abnormalities in WS.\n\nSources:\n- National Organization for Rare Disorders: Williams Syndrome.

The anemia is usually macrocytic (large red blood cells) and normochromic (normal hemoglobin content).\n\n2. **Physical Features**: Many patients with DBA have distinctive physical features, including:\n   - Short stature\n   - Abnormal facial features (e.g., prominent forehead, flat nasal bridge, small chin)\n   - Developmental delay or intellectual disability in some cases\n   - Congenital malformations, such as heart defects, kidney abnormalities, or limb defects, in about 30-40% of patients\n\n3. **Bone Marrow Failure**: DBA is caused by a failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. This is often associated with an increased number of white blood cells and platelets in the blood.\n\n4. **Genetic Factors**: DBA is often caused by mutations in genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. The most common gene affected is RPS19, but mutations in other genes like RPS24, RPS17, and RPL5 can also cause DBA.\n\n5. **Treatment**: The mainstay of treatment for DBA is regular blood transfusions to manage anemia.

One key regulator is the transcription factor NF-κB. NF-κB can bind to the promoter region of the SerH3 gene, enhancing its transcription and thus increasing SerH3 expression. Another regulator is the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Activation of PKC can lead to the phosphorylation of SerH3, which can alter its activity and stability. Additionally, certain cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), can induce SerH3 expression by activating signaling pathways that lead to NF-κB activation. Conversely, some inhibitors, like dexamethasone, can suppress SerH3 expression by inhibiting NF-κB activation. Therefore, the expression of SerH3 can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels, and it is influenced by various signaling pathways and external stimuli.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Regulation of SerH3 Expression in Tetrahymena thermophila: mRNA stability plays a major role in regulating the expression of SerH3.

These tangles disrupt the neuron's structure and function, leading to neuronal death.\n\n2. **Loss of Tau's Normal Function**: Tau's normal function is to stabilize microtubules, which are essential for transporting nutrients and other materials within the neuron. When tau is hyperphosphorylated, it can no longer bind to microtubules, leading to their destabilization and disruption of axonal transport.\n\n3. **Synaptic Loss**: The disruption of microtubules and the formation of NFTs can lead to a loss of synapses, which are the connections between neurons. This loss of synapses is thought to contribute to the cognitive impairment seen in Alzheimer's disease.\n\n4. **Neuronal Death**: The combination of these factors - the formation of NFTs, the loss of tau's normal function, and the loss of synapses - ultimately leads to neuronal death.

This loss of synapses is thought to contribute to the cognitive impairment seen in Alzheimer's disease.\n\n4. **Neuronal Death**: The combination of these factors - the formation of NFTs, the loss of tau's normal function, and the loss of synapses - ultimately leads", "[12]\nsource: external, content: Oxytocin - The Bonding Hormone: Oxytocin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in social bonding, especially in maternal behavior and between romantic partners.

The", "[12]\nsource: external, content: Angelman Syndrome - Genetics Home Reference: Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that results from the loss of function of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13). This region is imprinted, meaning that only the maternal copy of the gene is expressed in most tissues. If the deletion occurs in the paternally inherited chromosome 15, the individual will not develop Angelman Syndrome. Instead, they may develop a different genetic disorder called Prader-Willi Syndrome, which is also associated with deletions in the same region of chromosome 15 but on the paternal copy. Therefore, the disease associated with deletion of the paternally inherited chromosome 15 is Prader-Willi Syndrome.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Prader-Willi Syndrome - Genetics Home Reference: Prader-Willi syndrome is a genetic disorder that results from the loss of function of the paternal copy of several genes in a specific region of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13). This region is imprinted, meaning that only the paternal copy of these genes is expressed in most tissues. The loss of function of these genes can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, including severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and distinctive physical features.\n\nAnalysis:\nFrom the provided documents, we can consolidate the information into two main points:\n\n1. **Angelman Syndrome (AS) - Maternal Inheritance:**\n   - AS is characterized by severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, gait ataxia, tremulousness, unique behavior, and a happy demeanor (Source: [1]).\n   - It is caused by a loss of function of the UBE3A gene on the maternal copy of chromosome 15 (Source: [4], [10], [11], [12]).\n   - The most common cause is a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 (Source: [3], [7]).\n   - In 1-2% of cases, the deletion may be inherited from an abnormality in the maternal chromosome 15 (Source: [5]).\n   - AS is not typically inherited (Source: [2]).\n\n2. **Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) - Paternal Inheritance:**\n   - PWS is associated with deletions in the same region of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13) but on the paternal copy (Source: [11], [12], [13]).\n   - It is characterized by severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and distinctive physical features (Source: [13]).\n   - If the deletion occurs in the paternally inherited chromosome 15, individuals do not develop Angelman Syndrome but instead develop Prader-Willi Syndrome (Source: [11], [12]).\n\nDocuments [1], [3], [4], [7], [10], [11], [12] provide consistent information about Angelman Syndrome and its association with maternal inheritance and deletion of the maternal copy of chromosome 15. Documents [11], [12], and [13] provide consistent information about Prader-Willi Syndrome and its association with paternal inheritance and deletion of the paternal copy of chromosome 15.\n\nDocument [2] is excluded as it provides information about the non-inherited nature of AS, which is not relevant to the query about the disease associated with deletion of the paternally inherited chromosome 15.\n\nDocument [5] is excluded as it provides information about the rare cases where the deletion is inherited from an abnormality in the maternal chromosome 15, which is not relevant to the query about the disease associated with deletion of the paternally inherited chromosome 15.\n\nDocument [6] is excluded as it provides information about Prader-Willi Syndrome but does not mention the association with deletion of the paternal copy of chromosome 15.\n\nDocument [8] is excluded as it provides information about the symptoms of Angelman Syndrome but does not provide any genetic information.\n\nDocument [9] is excluded as it provides information about the deletion of a part of chromosome 15 in both AS and PWS but does not specify the parental inheritance.\n\nNew Document:\n**Angelman Syndrome and Prader-Willi Syndrome - Differential Diagnosis Based on Parental Inheritance:**\nAngelman Syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) are both associated with deletions in the same region of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13). However, the disease that develops depends on the parental inheritance of the deletion:\n\n- **Angelman Syndrome (AS):** If the deletion occurs in the maternal copy of chromosome 15, individuals develop Angelman Syndrome. AS is characterized by severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, gait ataxia, tremulousness, unique behavior,", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Document: In eukaryotes, neighborhoods of transcriptional regulation are created through several key effects:\n\n1. **Chromatin Structure**: Eukaryotic DNA is wrapped around histone proteins to form chromatin. The structure of chromatin can be altered by post-translational modifications of histones, creating regions of open (euchromatin) or closed (heterochromatin) chromatin. These structural changes can influence gene expression, with open chromatin being more accessible to transcription factors and RNA polymerase, leading to increased transcription.\n\n2. **DNA Methylation**: Methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides is another key mechanism for regulating transcription. Methylation in promoter regions can repress transcription, while demethylation can activate it. This is particularly important in silencing repetitive elements and imprinted genes.\n\n3. **Transcription Factors and Co-factors**: Transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences, often near promoters, and recruit co-factors to regulate transcription. They can activate or repress transcription, depending on the specific factor and context.\n\n4. **RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) Pausing**: RNAPII can pause shortly after initiation of transcription, creating a window for regulatory factors to influence transcription. This pausing is regulated by the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and can affect alternative splicing and polyadenylation.\n\n5. **Histone Acetylation**: Acetylation of histone tails can make chromatin more accessible, promoting transcription. This is often mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylated by histone deacetylases (HDACs).\n\n6. **Chromatin Remodeling**: ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes can slide, eject, or rearrange nucleosomes, making DNA more accessible to transcription factors and RNAPII. This can activate or repress transcription, depending on the specific complex and context.\n\nThese effects work together in a complex interplay to create neighborhoods of transcriptional regulation, allowing cells to fine-tune gene expression in response to internal and external cues.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Regulation of Transcription in Eukaryotes - The Cell - NCBI - NIH: Transcription in eukaryotic cells is controlled by proteins that bind to specific regulatory sequences and modulate the activity of RNA polymerase.\n\n[14]\nsource: external, content: 19: Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes: Various active genes can be transcribed at distinctive rates, primarily determined by the differences in rate of initiation.\n\n[15]\nsource: external, content: Overview: Eukaryotic gene regulation (article): The transcription factors bind to certain sequences of DNA in the nucleus and cause transcription of cell division-related genes.

Document: Prevotellaceae bacteria are a family of bacteria that are commonly found in the human gut microbiome. They are known for their ability to break down complex carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids, which can have beneficial effects on gut health. However, the colonization of Prevotellaceae bacteria in the gut can vary greatly from person to person.\n\nSeveral factors can influence the preferential colonization of Prevotellaceae bacteria in the gut. These include:\n\n1. **Diet**: A diet rich in complex carbohydrates, such as fiber, can promote the growth of Prevotellaceae bacteria. Conversely, a diet high in fat and protein can lead to a decrease in these bacteria.\n\n2. **Age**: Prevotellaceae bacteria are more prevalent in the guts of infants and young children. As we age, the composition of our gut microbiome shifts, and Prevotellaceae bacteria may become less dominant.\n\n3. **Geographic Location**: Studies have shown that the prevalence of Prevotellaceae bacteria can vary depending on the geographic location. For instance, they are more common in the guts of individuals from rural Africa and Asia compared to those from urbanized, Western countries.\n\n4. **Health Status**: Certain health conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, can alter the gut microbiome and lead to a decrease in Prevotellaceae bacteria.\n\n5. **Genetics**: Our genes can also play a role in determining the composition of our gut microbiome. Some individuals may have genetic predispositions that make their guts more hospitable to Prevotellaceae bacteria.\n\nTherefore, it's not a specific individual or group of individuals that show preferential colonization of Prevotellaceae bacteria, but rather a combination of factors that can influence their presence in the gut. These factors can vary greatly from person to person, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific group that preferentially harbors these bacteria.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Prevotella species as oral residents and infectious agents ... - PMC: PMC Copyright notice   PMCID: PMC9662046  PMID: 36393976  ABSTRACT Oral Prevotella are known as anaerobic commensals on oral mucosae and in dental plaques from early life onwards, including pigmented P. copri and P. nigrescens.

It is the causal agent of Fusarium wilt, also known as vascular wilt, in tomatoes. This disease is characterized by the blockage of the plant's water-conducting vessels, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventually, the death of the plant. The fungus enters the plant through the roots and colonizes the xylem vessels, causing them to clog with a gel-like substance, preventing water and nutrients from reaching the leaves. The most common symptom of Fusarium wilt in tomatoes is the wilting of the entire plant, even when the soil is moist. The disease can affect plants at any stage of growth, but it is most severe in hot, dry conditions. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici is a significant threat to tomato production worldwide, causing substantial crop losses.

"[12]\nsource: external, content: ALK in Cancer: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in the development and progression of several types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs). ALK is often mutated or rearranged in these cancers, leading to the production of abnormal ALK proteins that promote cancer cell growth.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: ALK in Neuroblastoma: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in the development and progression of neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that affects young children. ALK is often mutated in neuroblastoma, with at least 16 different mutations identified in people with this cancer. These mutations can lead to the production of abnormal ALK proteins that promote cancer cell growth.\n[14]\nsource: internal, content: ALK tyrosine kinase associated with? Document: Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is associated with several diseases, most notably Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). ALK is involved in the development and progression of NSCLC through its role in cell signaling and growth. In NSCLC, ALK is often fused with other genes, such as EML4, leading to the production of an abnormal ALK protein that is constantly active and promotes cancer cell growth. This fusion is known as the EML4-ALK fusion gene, and it is found in about 3-7% of NSCLC cases. Other diseases associated with ALK include anaplastic large cell lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and certain types of neuroblastoma. Therefore, the disease most associated with ALK is Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).\n[15]\nsource: external, content: ALK in Glioblastoma: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in the development and progression of glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer.

Database analysis has revealed that several ALK variants are associated with various metabolic traits, including thinness, BMI, and lipid and glucose homeostasis. This suggests that ALK may play a role in the regulation of metabolism and that variants in this gene may be associated with metabolic disorders.\n[18]\nsource: external, content: ALK in Development: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in the development of various tissues and organs. It is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival, and has been shown to be important for the development of the nervous system, the heart, and other tissues. ALK has also been implicated in the development of certain types of cancer, such as neuroblastoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\n[19]\nsource: external, content: ALK in Signaling: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in various signaling pathways. It is activated by the binding of certain ligands, such as midkine and pleiotrophin, and this leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways. ALK signaling has been shown to play a role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival, and has been implicated in the development of certain types of cancer.\n[20]\nsource: external, content: ALK in Cancer Therapy: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in the development and progression of several types of cancer. As a result, it has become an important target for cancer therapy. Several drugs have been developed that target ALK and inhibit its activity, such as crizotinib and ceritinib. These drugs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of certain types of cancer, such as non-small cell lung cancer and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\n[21]\nsource: external, content: ALK in Immunotherapy: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has been identified as a clinically druggable target for lung cancer.

Document: The 'probe to bone' test, also known as the percussion test, is commonly used in diagnosing Pott's disease, a form of spinal tuberculosis. This test involves percussing (tapping) the spine with a finger or a percussion hammer. If the spine feels 'hollow' or 'tubular', it may indicate the presence of Pott's disease, as this suggests that there is a cavity or abscess in the spine due to the infection. However, it's important to note that this test is not conclusive on its own and is typically used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods such as X-rays, MRI scans, and laboratory tests.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe \"probe to bone\" test is primarily used for diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis, as indicated by the majority of the external sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).

Here's how Brigatinib works:\n\n1. **ALK Inhibition**: Brigatinib is an ALK inhibitor. This means it blocks the activity of the ALK protein, which is produced in excess due to the ALK gene fusion in certain types of cancer. By inhibiting ALK, Brigatinib can slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells.\n\n2. **ROS1 Inhibition**: In addition to ALK, Brigatinib also inhibits ROS1, another tyrosine kinase that can be involved in the growth of certain cancers. This dual inhibition makes Brigatinib effective against both ALK-positive and ROS1-positive cancers.\n\n3. **Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Localization**: Brigatinib is unique among ALK inhibitors because it can localize to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This allows it to target both the ALK and ROS1 proteins, which are located in different cellular compartments.\n\n4. **Indirect Inhibition of Other Kinases**: While Brigatinib is selective for ALK and ROS1, it can also indirectly inhibit other kinases, such as AXL and RET, at higher concentrations. This is thought to contribute to its clinical activity.\n\nIn summary, Brigatinib works by inhibiting the ALK and ROS1 proteins, which are often overexpressed or mutated in certain types of cancer. This inhibition can slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells and may also induce cell death.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Brigatinib is a small molecule compound that inhibits anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ROS1, being developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ALK or ROS1 rearrangements.\n\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Brigatinib is a next-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor designed to overcome mechanisms of resistance associated with crizotinib, a first-generation ALK inhibitor.

Several metabolic pathways have been associated with SLE, including:\n\n1. **Type I Interferon Pathway**: This pathway is often dysregulated in SLE patients. Type I interferons, such as IFN-α, are produced in response to viral infections and can stimulate the production of autoantibodies, which are a hallmark of SLE.\n\n2. **Complement Pathway**: The complement system is a part of the immune response that can cause the destruction of cells. In SLE, the complement system is often overactive, leading to tissue damage.\n\n3. **T Cell Activation Pathway**: T cells play a crucial role in the immune response. In SLE, T cells can become overactive and stimulate the production of autoantibodies.\n\n4. **B Cell Activation Pathway**: B cells are responsible for producing antibodies. In SLE, B cells can become overactive and produce autoantibodies that attack healthy tissue.\n\n5. **Apoptosis Pathway**: Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a normal process in the body. However, in SLE, the clearance of apoptotic debris can be impaired, leading to the accumulation of nuclear antigens that can trigger an autoimmune response.\n\n6. **Mitochondrial Pathway**: Mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in SLE patients. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage DNA and proteins, potentially triggering an autoimmune response.\n\n7. **Metabolic Syndrome Pathway**: Metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, has been linked to SLE. This pathway involves dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and obesity.\n\n8. **Glycolysis and Oxidative Phosphorylation**: These are major pathways in which metabolic abnormalities have been reported in lupus, according to [2].\n\n9. **Steroid Hormone Biosynthesis and Tryptophan Metabolism**: These pathways have been found to be changed in SLE patients, as mentioned in [6].\n\n10. **Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Enhanced Oxidative Stress**: These have been linked to the pathogenesis of SLE, as discussed in [7].\n\n11. **Impaired Metabolism of T Cells**: This is recognized as an important contributor to the pathogenicity of T cells in SLE, as stated in [4].\n\n12. **Increased Oxidative Activity and Urea Cycle Turnover**: These have been observed in SLE patients, as reported in [1].\n\n13. **Vitamin D Deficiency**: This is associated with the disease activity and proteinuria in SLE patients, as mentioned in [5].\n\n14. **Immune Metabolism Alterations in CD4+ T Cells, B Cells, and Myeloid Cells**: These have been reviewed as potential contributors to lupus pathogenesis, as discussed in [3].\n\n15. **Metabolic Alterations in Vitamin D Deficient SLE Patients**: These have been studied in [5].\n\n16. **Potential Biomarkers and Metabolic Pathways in SLE and Lupus Nephritis**: These have been explored in [8].\n\n17. **Oxidative Stress in SLE**: This has been associated with alterations in the immune system and autoantibody production, as well as cardiovascular complications of the disease, as mentioned in [10].\n\n18. **Metabolic Effects of Current Therapies in SLE**: Biomarkers from the glycolytic pathway could indicate adverse metabolic effects of current therapies, as discussed in [9].\n\nConsolidated Information:\n\n**Metabolic Pathways Associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**\n\n1. **Immune Metabolism Pathways**:\n   - Glycolysis and Oxidative Phosphorylation (Major pathways with reported abnormalities in lupus, [2])\n   - Impaired Metabolism of T Cells (Contributes to T cell pathogenicity in SLE, [4])\n   - Metabolic Alterations in CD4+ T Cells, B Cells, and Myeloid Cells (Potential contributors to lupus pathogenesis, [3])\n   - Oxidative Stress (Associated with immune system alterations, autoantibody production, and cardiovascular complications, [10])\n\n2. **Mitochondrial Pathways**:\n   - Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Enhanced Oxidative Stress (Linked to SLE pathogenesis, [7])\n   - Mitochondrial Pathway (Observed dysfunction in SLE patients, [11])\n   - Increased Oxidative Activity (Reported in SLE patients, [1])\n\n3. **Metabolic Pathways with Abnormalities in SLE Patients**:\n   - Steroid Hormone Biosynthesis and Tryptophan Metabolism (Found to be changed in SLE patients, [6])\n   - Urea Cycle Turnover (Observed in SLE patients, [1])\n\n4. **Other Metabolic Factors Associated with SLE**:\n   - Vitamin D Deficiency (Associated with disease activity and proteinuria, [", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Caplacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that specifically targets von Willebrand factor (vWF).

Document: STEF (Stimulator of eIF2α phosphorylation) depletion has several significant effects, primarily related to protein synthesis and cell stress responses. Here are some key effects:\n\n1. **Impaired Protein Synthesis**: STEF is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis. Depletion of STEF leads to a decrease in global protein synthesis rates. This is due to STEF's role in facilitating the assembly of initiation complexes during translation.\n\n2. **Activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)**: When STEF is depleted, there's an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This triggers the UPR, a signaling pathway that aims to restore ER homeostasis. The UPR can lead to both adaptive and apoptotic responses, depending on the severity and duration of the stress.\n\n3. **Increased Oxidative Stress**: STEF depletion has been linked to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress. This is thought to be due to the accumulation of unfolded proteins and the activation of the UPR.\n\n4. **Altered Cell Cycle Progression**: Some studies have shown that STEF depletion can lead to cell cycle arrest, particularly in the G1 phase. This is likely due to the activation of stress response pathways.\n\n5. **Inhibition of Autophagy**: STEF has been found to regulate autophagy, a process crucial for cell survival during stress conditions. Depletion of STEF can inhibit autophagy, leading to impaired cell survival and proliferation.\n\n6. **Increased Sensitivity to Stress**: Cells depleted of STEF are more sensitive to various stress conditions, such as ER stress, oxidative stress, and nutrient deprivation. This is due to the impaired stress response pathways and increased basal stress levels.\n\nWhile these are the known effects of STEF depletion, it's important to note that the specific outcomes can vary depending on the cell type, the extent of STEF depletion, and the specific stress conditions. Therefore, the effects of STEF depletion should be interpreted in the context of these variables.\n\nI don’t know: The document does not provide information on the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, nor does it discuss any potential therapeutic implications of STEF depletion. Additionally, it does not provide information on the reversibility of these effects upon STEF repletion.\nAnswer: Based on the provided information, the effects of STEF depletion include:\n\n1. **Impaired Protein Synthesis**: STEF plays a role in regulating protein synthesis.

This is due to the impaired stress response pathways and increased basal stress levels.\n\nThese effects should be interpreted in the context of the cell type, the extent of STEF depletion, and the specific stress conditions, as the specific outcomes can vary depending on these variables.", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Olaratumab targets PDGFRα, not PDGFRβ.

Document: Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is primarily used as a tumor marker in the diagnosis and monitoring of certain types of cancer. Here are some key points about its use:\n\n1. **Liver Cancer (Hepatocellular Carcinoma)**: AFP is most commonly used as a marker for liver cancer. Elevated AFP levels (above 20 ng/mL) can indicate the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, AFP can also be elevated in other conditions, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and germ cell tumors, so it's not always a definitive test.\n\n2. **Germ Cell Tumors**: AFP is also used to monitor the treatment and recurrence of germ cell tumors, such as testicular and ovarian cancers. In these cases, AFP levels are typically elevated above 1000 ng/mL.\n\n3. **Fetal Development**: During pregnancy, AFP is produced by the fetus and can be detected in the mother's blood. This is used in prenatal screening for neural tube defects and other fetal abnormalities.\n\n4. **Monitoring Treatment**: In patients with liver cancer or germ cell tumors, AFP levels are monitored during and after treatment. A decrease in AFP levels indicates that the treatment is working, while an increase may suggest recurrence.\n\nWhile AFP is a useful marker, it's important to note that it's not always reliable on its own. It's often used in conjunction with other tests, such as imaging studies, to make a diagnosis or monitor treatment.

It consists of a single protein, Cpf1, which acts as both the nuclease and the guide RNA binding protein.\n   - CRISPR-Cas9, on the other hand, is a type II system from *Streptococcus pyogenes*, and it consists of two proteins: Cas9 and a separate guide RNA.\n\n2. **Guide RNA Structure**:\n   - Cpf1 uses a single guide RNA (sgRNA) that is processed within the cell, resulting in a mature guide RNA with a 5' handle and a 3' handle. The 5' handle is important for Cpf1's activity.\n   - Cas9 uses a sgRNA with a 5' handle (GUUUUAGAGCUA) and a 3' handle (UUUUUU), but the 3' handle is not required for Cas9's activity.\n\n3. **DNA Cleavage**:\n   - Cpf1 generates staggered DNA double-strand breaks, with a 5' overhang, similar to Cas9. However, Cpf1 cleaves DNA 18-20 bp downstream of the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), while Cas9 cleaves 3 bp upstream of the PAM.\n   - Cpf1 can also generate double-strand breaks with higher efficiency than Cas9 in some cases.\n\n4. **PAM Sequence**:\n   - Cpf1 recognizes a PAM sequence of TTTV (where V is A, C, or G), while Cas9 recognizes a PAM sequence of NGG.\n\n5. **Off-target Effects**:\n   - Cpf1 has been shown to have lower off-target effects compared to Cas9 in some studies, but this can vary depending on the specific guide RNA and target sequence.\n\nIn summary, while CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) and CRISPR-Cas9 share some similarities, they differ in their origin, structure, guide RNA processing, DNA cleavage, PAM recognition, and off-target effects.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: CRISPR-Cas12a vs CRISPR-Cas9: A Comparative Study - ResearchGate: CRISPR-Cas12a and CRISPR-Cas9 are two popular systems used for genome editing.

It does this by comparing the connectivity of atoms in each molecule, ignoring the order of atoms and the presence of hydrogen. This allows the tool to group together molecules that have the same connectivity but different arrangements of atoms or hydrogen, treating them as a single unique structure. The UC2 search tool is particularly useful for analyzing large libraries of compounds, such as those found in chemical databases, to identify and remove duplicates or near-duplicates based on molecular structure. It can also help in the process of de-duplication, where multiple representations of the same molecule are reduced to a single, unique entry. The tool is not designed to consider the stereochemistry of molecules, as it only takes into account the connectivity of atoms. Therefore, it will treat (R)- and (S)-enantiomers as the same structure. The UC2 search tool is a valuable tool for chemists and chemical informaticians working with large datasets of uncharged compounds, helping to simplify and organize these datasets for further analysis or use.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[14]\nsource: external, content: UC2 search: using unique connectivity of uncharged compounds for metabolite annotation by database searching in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics\n\n[15]\nsource: external, content: “MS-Ready” structures for non-targeted high-resolution mass ...: 1253611     journal  November 2016                    UC2 search: using unique connectivity of uncharged compounds for metabolite annotation by database searching in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics   Sakurai, Nozomu; Narise, Takafumi; Sim, Joon-Soo  Bioinformatics, Vol.\n\n[16]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[17]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[18]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[19]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[20]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[21]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[22]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[23]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[24]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[25]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[26]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[27]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[28]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[29]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[30]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[31]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[32]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[33]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[34]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[35]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the same compounds among the databases by UC2 search.\n\n[36]\nsource: external, content: Kazusa MFSearcher: removing redundancy of the", "[12]\nsource: external, content: Talnetant -

Document: Genome segmentation of gene expression data involves dividing the genome into segments based on patterns of gene expression. Several methods are used for this purpose, including:\n\n1. **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**: HMMs are probabilistic models that can be used to segment the genome into regions of similar gene expression. They model the genome as a sequence of hidden states, where each state corresponds to a particular expression pattern. The most common HMM used for this purpose is the Gaussian HMM, which assumes that the expression levels within each state follow a Gaussian distribution.\n\n2. **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)**: SOMs are a type of artificial neural network that uses unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional representation of the input space, called a map. In the context of genome segmentation, SOMs can be used to cluster genes based on their expression patterns, and then these clusters can be used to segment the genome.\n\n3. **K-Means Clustering**: K-Means is a simple and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm for clustering data. In genome segmentation, K-Means can be used to group genes based on their expression patterns, and then these clusters can be used to segment the genome.\n\n4. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Hierarchical clustering is another unsupervised machine learning algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters. It can be used to segment the genome by grouping genes based on their expression patterns and then merging these groups to form a tree of clusters.\n\n5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can also be used for genome segmentation. It identifies the directions of maximum variance in the data and uses these to segment the genome.\n\nEach of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method may depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the research question being addressed.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Genome segmentation of gene expression data involves dividing the genome into segments based on patterns of gene expression.

Document: Retrotransposons, Insertion Sequences (ISs), and Retrotranson Insertion Sequence (RIDLs) are all types of transposable elements, but they differ in their mechanism of transposition and structure. Here's how RIDLs differ from other transposable elements:\n\n1. **Structure**: RIDLs are composite elements, meaning they are composed of parts from different transposable elements. They typically consist of a retrotransposon at one end and an IS at the other. This unique structure allows them to mobilize through both retrotransposition (copying and pasting) and transposition (cutting and pasting).\n\n2. **Transposition Mechanism**: Unlike typical retrotransposons, which use a 'copy and paste' mechanism, RIDLs can use both 'copy and paste' and 'cut and paste' mechanisms. The retrotransposon part of the RIDL uses the 'copy and paste' mechanism, while the IS part uses the 'cut and paste' mechanism. This dual mechanism allows them to insert into new locations in the genome more frequently than other transposable elements.\n\n3. **Mobilization**: Due to their unique structure and transposition mechanism, RIDLs can mobilize even when the host genome is under stress or undergoing DNA repair. This makes them more likely to spread and diversify within a genome compared to other transposable elements.\n\nIn summary, RIDLs are unique among transposable elements due to their composite structure, their ability to use both retrotransposition and transposition mechanisms, and their increased mobilization potential.\n\n[12]\nsource: external, content: Retrotransposon Insertion Sequences (RIDLs) - ResearchGate: Retrotransposon Insertion Sequences (RIDLs) are a unique class of transposable elements that combine features of retrotransposons and insertion sequences.

These methods use the topology of biological networks to infer the function of genes and prioritize them based on their connectivity and proximity to known disease genes. Some of the most popular methods include:\n- Network Propagation: This method uses a seed set of known disease genes to propagate information through the network, assigning a score to each gene based on its connectivity and proximity to the seed genes. Genes with higher scores are considered more likely to be associated with the disease.\n- Random Walk with Restart: This method is similar to Network Propagation but it also takes into account the connectivity of the entire network, not just the local neighborhood of the seed genes.\n- Guilt by Association: This method is based on the observation that similar mutational phenotypes arise from functionally related genes. It prioritizes genes based on their similarity to known disease genes in the network.\n- Pathway Analysis: This method uses knowledge of biological pathways to prioritize genes. It assigns a score to each gene based on its role in known pathways and its connectivity to other genes in those pathways.\n- Network Hub-Node Prioritization: This method identifies and prioritizes the influential hub genes in a gene-set or biological pathway. It relies on calculation of marginal effects or tests of statistical significance.\n- Network-based Boosting: This method uses machine learning algorithms to prioritize genes. It trains a classifier on known disease genes and uses it to predict the likelihood of other genes being associated with the disease.\n- Weighted In-Network Node Expansion and Ranking (WINNER): This is a new biomolecular characterization and prioritization tool that uses a network-based approach to prioritize genes. It assigns a score to each gene based on its connectivity and its role in known pathways.\n- Network-based Disease-Gene Prioritization: This is a general term that encompasses all network-based methods for prioritizing disease genes. It includes the methods listed above, as well as other methods that use the topology of biological networks to infer the function of genes and prioritize them based on their connectivity and proximity to known disease genes.\nThe choice of method may depend on the specific characteristics of the network and the disease in question. Some methods may be more suitable for certain types of networks or diseases than others. Additionally, some methods may be more computationally intensive than others, and may require more computational resources to implement.", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to control sleep-wake cycles. It is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and often associated with other symptoms. The narcolepsy pentad refers to a combination of five symptoms that are commonly associated with narcolepsy. These symptoms are:\n\n1. **Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS)**: This is the primary symptom of narcolepsy. It's characterized by persistent sleepiness during the day, even after a full night's sleep.\n\n2. **Cataplexy**: This is a sudden and temporary loss of muscle control or muscle weakness, often triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, surprise, or anger. It can range from slight drooping of the eyelids to complete body collapse.\n\n3. **Sleep Paralysis**: This is a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. It can last from a few seconds to several minutes.\n\n4. **Hypnagogic Hallucinations**: These are vivid, often frightening, dreams or hallucinations that occur while falling asleep. They can involve any of the senses, but are most commonly visual.\n\n5. **Sleep Disruption**: This refers to fragmented sleep at night, with frequent awakenings and difficulty staying asleep.

Document: Kallisto is a high-throughput RNA-seq analysis tool that enables fast and accurate quantification of transcripts. Here are some main advantages of Kallisto over similar methodologies:\n\n1. **Speed**: Kallisto is significantly faster than other methods like Salmon or RSEM. This is because Kallisto uses a novel algorithm called 'pseudo-alignment' which maps reads to a set of k-mers (short subsequences of length k) instead of full transcripts. This approach reduces the computational complexity, making Kallisto up to 100x faster.\n\n2. **Accuracy**: Despite its speed, Kallisto maintains high accuracy in estimating the abundance of transcripts. It uses a statistical model to estimate the number of transcripts that map to each k-mer, allowing it to accurately quantify transcripts even with a single read.\n\n3. **Memory Efficiency**: Kallisto is more memory-efficient than other tools. This is due to its compact data structure and the fact that it only needs to store the k-mers, not the full transcripts. This makes Kallisto suitable for analyzing large datasets on machines with limited memory.\n\n4. **Broad Applicability**: Kallisto can be used for a wide range of applications, including single-cell RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and even metatranscriptomics. It can also handle different types of RNA-seq data, such as stranded or non-stranded, and can be used with various reference transcriptomes.\n\n5. **Bias Correction**: Kallisto includes a bias correction feature that helps to mitigate biases introduced during library preparation and sequencing. This ensures that the transcript abundance estimates are more accurate and reliable.\n\n6. **Integration with Other Tools**: Kallisto can be easily integrated with other tools in the RNA-seq analysis pipeline. For example, it can be used in conjunction with tools like Sleuth for differential expression analysis or with tools like tximport for converting raw counts to gene-level estimates.\n\n7. **Open Source**: Kallisto is open-source and freely available, making it accessible to researchers with limited budgets. It also has an active community of users and developers, ensuring that it continues to be improved and updated.\n\nIn conclusion, Kallisto's speed, accuracy, memory efficiency, broad applicability, bias correction, integration with other tools, and open-source nature make it a powerful and versatile tool for RNA-seq analysis.\n\nSource: [Kallisto documentation](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/) and [Comparative analysis of RNA-seq quantification methods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426182/)\n\n[12]\nsource: external, content: Kallisto vs. Salmon: Salmon is a tool for quantifying the expression of transcripts from RNA-seq data.

This is often referred to as primary non-response. Additionally, another 10-20% of patients may initially respond but eventually lose their response over time, known as secondary non-response. Therefore, it can be estimated that around 40-60% of RA patients may not have a long-term beneficial response to anti-TNF therapy.

I don’t know the exact percentage for each specific anti-TNF medication, nor the percentage of patients who may experience a delayed response.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: [PDF] Drug outcome survey to evaluate anti-TNF treatment in rheumatoid ...: However, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to anti-TNF drugs. Only 50–70% of patients receiv- ing anti-TNF therapy achieved at least a 20% ...\n\nAnalysis:\nFrom the provided documents, we can see that there is a significant variation in the percentage of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients who do not respond to anti-TNF therapy. Here's a summary:\n\n1. **Consistent Information (Clustered):**\n   - Documents [1], [2], [4], [6], [8], [12], and [13] suggest that approximately 30% to 40% of RA patients do not respond to anti-TNF therapy initially (primary non-response), and another 10% to 20% may respond initially but lose their response over time (secondary non-response). This results in around 40% to 60% of RA patients not having a long-term beneficial response to anti-TNF therapy.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Information (Separated):**\n   - Document [3] reports that a considerable proportion of patients with RA did not have a response to their initial TNF inhibitor treatment 6 or 12 months after treatment initiation, but it doesn't provide a specific percentage.\n   - Document [5] simply states that a failure to respond to TNF inhibitors remains a serious concern for patients with RA without providing a percentage.\n   - Document [7] suggests that only 50–70% of patients receiving anti-TNF therapy achieved at least a 20% improvement, implying that 30% to 50% did not respond adequately.\n\n3. **Irrelevant Information (Excluded):**\n   - Document [9] discusses the high rate of inadequate response to biologics in patients initiating treatment for RA but doesn't provide specific percentages for anti-TNF therapy.\n\n4. **New Information (Added):**\n   - Document [12] provides the same information as document [11], which was already included in the analysis.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the majority of the documents, approximately 40% to 60% of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients may not have a long-term beneficial response to anti-TNF therapy. However, the exact percentage can vary depending on the specific anti-TNF medication used, the patient's individual response, and other factors.", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints.

These disorders are characterized by a range of clinical phenotypes and molecular genetic features. Here's a list of the most common clinical phenotypes and molecular genetic features associated with KMT2B-related disorders:\n\nClinical Phenotypes:\n1. **Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability**: This is one of the most common features of KMT2B-related disorders. It can range from mild to severe.\n2. **Dysmorphic Features**: Many patients have distinctive facial features, including a prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, a small nose, and a small chin.\n3. **Growth Retardation**: Delayed growth and short stature are common in these disorders.\n4. **Seizures**: Some patients may experience seizures, often starting in infancy.\n5. **Behavioral Abnormalities**: These can include hyperactivity, autistic-like behaviors, and sleep disturbances.\n6. **Skeletal Abnormalities**: Some patients may have skeletal abnormalities, such as clinodactyly (curved fifth finger) and brachydactyly (shortening of the bones in the hands and feet).\n7. **Hearing Impairment**: Some patients may have hearing loss.\n\nMolecular Genetic Features:\n1. **KMT2B Gene Mutations**: The most common cause of KMT2B-related disorders is mutations in the KMT2B gene. These mutations can be deletions, duplications, or point mutations.\n2. **Chromosome 9q34.3 Deletions**: Many patients have a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 9 at the q34.3 position, which includes the KMT2B gene.\n3. **Triplication of the KMT2B Region**: Some patients have a triplication of the KMT2B region, which can also cause the disorder.\n4. **Point Mutations**: Less commonly, point mutations in the KMT2B gene can cause the disorder. These mutations can affect the function of the KMT2B protein.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: KMT2B-related disorders: expansion of the phenotypic spectrum ...: We describe a cohort of 53 patients with KMT2B mutations, with detailed delineation of their clinical phenotype and molecular genetic features.

Instead, they are caused by modifications to histones or other proteins that interact with DNA, altering how genes are read and expressed.\n\nIn the model organism C. elegans, the rate of epimutations has been studied to understand how these changes contribute to phenotypic variation and evolution. However, the rate of epimutations in C. elegans is not as well-established as that of other types of mutations, such as point mutations or chromosomal rearrangements.\n\nA study published in the journal Genes & Development in 2010 estimated the rate of de novo epimutations in C. elegans to be around 0.01-0.02 per genome per generation. This means that, on average, about 1-2 epimutations occur in each C. elegans genome with each round of reproduction.\n\nAnother study, published in Nature Genetics in 2016, found that the rate of epimutation accumulation in C. elegans increased with age, with about 0.005 epimutations per genome per day in young worms and up to 0.015 in older worms.\n\nWhile these studies provide some insight into the rate of epimutations in C. elegans, it's important to note that the exact rate may vary depending on the specific genes and genomic regions studied, as well as the environmental conditions and experimental methods used.\n\nIn conclusion, the rate of epimutations in C. elegans is estimated to be around 0.01-0.02 per genome per generation, with an age-dependent accumulation rate. However, more research is needed to fully understand the dynamics and significance of epimutations in this organism.\n\nI don’t know: The exact rate of epimutations in C. elegans may vary depending on various factors, and further research is needed to provide a more precise estimate.\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans: We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations.\n\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans: We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations.\n\n[15]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans: We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations.\n\n[16]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans: We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations.\n\n[17]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans: We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations.\n\n[18]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans: We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations.\n\n[19]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans: We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations.\n\n[20]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans: We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations.\n\n[21]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenorhabditis elegans: We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of two to three generations.\n\n[22]\nsource: external, content: Epimutations driven by small RNAs arise frequently but most have limited duration in Caenor", "70+,171+,172+,173+,174+,175+,176+,177+,183+,184+,185+,186+,187+,188+,189+,190+,191+,192+,193+,194+,195+,196+,197+,198+,199+,200+,201+,202+,203+,204+,205+,206+,207+,208+,209+,210+,211+,212+,213+,214+,215+,216+,217+,218+,219+,220+,221+,222+,223+,224+,225+,226+,227+,228+,229+,230+,231+,232+,233+,234+,235+,236+,237+,238+,239+,240+,241+,242+,243+,244+,245+,246+,247+,248+,249+,250+,251+,252+,253+,254+,255+,256+,257+,258+,259+,260+,261+,262+,263+,264+,265+,266+,267+,268+,269+,270+,271+,272+,273+,274+,275+,276+,277+,278+,279+,280+,281+,282+,283+,284+,285+,286+,287+,288+,289+,290+,291+,292+,293+,294+,295+,296+,297+,298+,299+,300+,301+,302+,303+,304+,305+,306+,307+,308+,309+,310+,311+,312+,313+,314+,315+,316+,317+,318+,319+,320+,321+,322+,323+,324+,325+,326+,327+,328+,329+,330+,331+,332+,333+,334+,335+,336+,337+,338+,339+,340+,341+,342+,343+,344+,345+,346+,347+,348+,349+,350+,351+,352+,353+,354+,355+,356+,357+,358+,359+,360+,361+,362+,363+,364+,365+,366+,367+,368+,369+,370+,371+,372+,373+,374+,375+,376+,377+,378+,379+,380+,381+,382+,383+,384+,385+,386+,387+,388+,389+,390+,391+,392+,393+,394+,395+,396+,397+,398+,399+,400+,401+,402+,403+,404+,405+,406+,407+,408+,409+,410+,411+,412+,413+,414+,415+,416+,417+,418+,419+,420+,421+,422+,423+,424+,425+,426+,427+,428+,429+,430+,4", "[11]\nsource: internal, content: used for predicting disease progression in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy? Document: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe form of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects males. It's caused by a mutation in the DMD gene, which encodes for dystrophin, a protein crucial for muscle function. DMD is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, starting in the legs and pelvis, and eventually affecting the upper body and heart. Predicting disease progression in DMD is a complex task due to the variability in the disease's progression among individuals. Several models have been proposed to predict disease progression, including:\n\n1. **Clinical Models**: These models use clinical data such as age, muscle strength, and functional tests to predict disease progression. For instance, the 'Vignos Scale' and the 'Brooke Scale' are commonly used clinical models to assess muscle strength and predict disease progression.\n\n2. **Biomarker Models**: Biomarkers like creatine kinase (CK) levels, muscle MRI, and genetic modifiers have been explored to predict disease progression. For example, elevated CK levels have been associated with more severe disease progression.\n\n3. **Machine Learning Models**: Recent advancements in machine learning have led to the development of predictive models using large datasets. These models can incorporate various features like clinical data, genetic information, and even omics data (genomics, proteomics, etc.). Some examples include:\n   - A study published in 'Lancet Neurology' used a machine learning algorithm to predict age at loss of ambulation in DMD patients.\n   - Another study in 'PLOS ONE' used a random forest model to predict disease progression based on genetic modifiers.\n\n4. **Muscle MRI Models**: Muscle MRI has emerged as a powerful tool for assessing muscle damage and disease progression in DMD. Models using MRI features, such as fat fraction and muscle volume, have shown promise in predicting disease progression.\n\nWhile these models have shown promise, predicting disease progression in DMD remains challenging due to the disease's heterogeneity and the complexity of its progression. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy and robustness of these models.\n\n[1]\nsource: external, content: Five multivariate Duchenne muscular dystrophy progression models ...: Open in a new tab (A) MRI imaging of 5 leg muscles, (B) Five multivariate models bridging 6MWD and MRI-T2 biomarkers, (C) Data exclusion for developing multivariate modelsDisease progression models of Duchenne muscle dystrophy Among several base structural models, the sigmoid Imax and Emax models best captured the profiles of 6MWD and MRI-T2 over age, respectively, and the equations are as below.\n\n[2]\nsource: external, content: New Model May Explain Variability in DMD Progression: A new model could explain the variability of disease progression and response to treatment in patients with DMD, a study found.\n\n[3]\nsource: external, content: in-silico DMD: Developing computational predictive models for ... - Vivli: The main purpose of the in-silico DMD project is to make the most of available data about DMD, in order to produce computational models of disease progression.\n\n[4]\nsource: external, content: Canine models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and their use in ...: Various phenotypic tests have been developed to characterize disease progression in the GRMD model.\n\n[5]\nsource: external, content: Multi-scale machine learning model predicts muscle and functional ...: Multi-scale machine learning model predicts muscle and functional disease progression | Scientific Reports                                                                                                                                                                                                     Skip to main content   Thank you for visiting nature.\n\n[6]\nsource: external, content: Navigating the Heterogeneous Progression of Duchenne Muscular ...: Navigating the Heterogeneous Progression of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy | NeurologyLive - Clinical Neurology News and Neurology Expert Insights               NewsMediaAll VideosMedical World NewsPodcastsWeekly RecapCure ConnectionsInsightsSpecial ReportNeurologyLive Peer ExchangeClinical Forum InsightsMedcastPeers & PerspectivesRoundtable DiscussionsShows & PodcastsConferencesConference CoverageConference ListingCME/CEMorePartnersPublicationsNeurologyLiveBridging the GapsInternational Journal of MS CareResourcesExpert AuthorsFDA NewsFeaturesFellows' CornerFuture Leaders in NeurologyGiants of Multiple SclerosisInteractive ToolsJob BoardLive EventsNeurology ResourcesSponsoredVirtual EventsSubscribeMy AccountNewsMediaConferencesCME/CEPartnersPublicationsResourcesSubscribeDementia and Alzheimer DiseaseEpilepsyGenetic DisordersHeadache and MigraineMigraineMS and Demyelinating DisordersNMOSDMultiple SclerosisMovement DisordersParkinson DiseaseDyskinesiaNeuromuscularChronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyMuscular DystrophyAtaxiaRare DiseasesSleep DisordersNarcolepsyExcessive Daytime SleepinessInsomniaStroke", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Computational tools for predicting allosteric pathways in proteins include COFACTOR, AlloSite, AlloPred, AlloPath, and AlloSigMA.

Kaps do this by recognizing specific signals on their cargo and facilitating their transport through nuclear pore complexes.

One notable example is the gene 'DEAD-box helicase 3 Y-linked' (DBY), which was formed from a retrotransposed copy of the X-linked DBX gene around 3 million years ago. Another example is the gene 'CYP21A2 pseudogene', which arose from a duplication of the functional CYP21A2 gene around 40 million years ago. These examples demonstrate that de novo gene birth can occur relatively recently in human evolution and contribute to genetic diversity and adaptation.\nLast Context: [12]\nQuestion: Which was the first species in which a de novo gene emergence (\"gene birth\") was reported?\nNew Context: [12]\nAnalysis:\nThe initial context provided information about de novo gene birth, its process, and its occurrence in various species. However, none of these documents directly answered the question about the first species in which a de novo gene emergence was reported.\n\nThe new context [12] provides information about de novo gene birth in humans, but it does not mention any specific species as the first in which this phenomenon was observed.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, we cannot determine the first species in which a de novo gene emergence was reported.

These repeats are located within specific genes and their expansion can lead to the abnormal functioning of proteins, resulting in various diseases. Here are some of the diseases that fall under the category of Repeat Expansion Disorders:\n\n1. **Huntington's Disease (HD)**: Caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene, HD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects muscle coordination and cognitive abilities.\n\n2. **Fragile X Syndrome (FXS)**: This is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability. It's caused by an expansion of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene, leading to the absence or reduction of the FMRP protein.\n\n3. **Friedreich's Ataxia (FA)**: FA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by an expansion of GAA repeats in the FXN gene. This leads to a loss of function of the frataxin protein, resulting in progressive neurological symptoms.\n\n4. **Myotonic Dystrophy (DM)**: Also known as Steinert's disease, DM is caused by an expansion of CTG repeats in the DMPK gene. It's characterized by myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction) and progressive muscle wasting.\n\n5. **Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA)**: This is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the AR gene. It leads to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy.\n\n6. **Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA)**: Also known as Haw River syndrome, DRPLA is caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the ATN1 gene. It's characterized by progressive motor dysfunction, ataxia, and cognitive impairment.\n\n7. **Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA)**: There are multiple types of SCA, each caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in different genes.

It is caused by a mutation in the FXN gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin.\n\nThe mode of inheritance of Friedreich’s ataxia is autosomal recessive. This means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated FXN gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition. If a person inherits one normal copy of the gene and one mutated copy, they are a carrier but do not typically show symptoms of the disorder. However, carriers can pass the mutated gene on to their children.\n\nIn rare cases, Friedreich’s ataxia can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but this accounts for less than 5% of cases. In these instances, a person only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene from one parent to develop the condition.\n\nIn summary, the mode of inheritance for Friedreich’s ataxia is primarily autosomal recessive, with a small percentage of cases being autosomal dominant.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Friedreich's Ataxia - Genetics Home Reference: Inheritance PatternsFriedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder.

It is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which is located on the X chromosome. The dystrophin gene is one of the largest genes in the human genome, spanning approximately 2.4 million base pairs and containing 79 exons. The most common mutation locations in the dystrophin gene in DMD are:\n\n1. **Exon 2**: This exon is the most frequently affected, accounting for about 15-20% of all DMD mutations. Mutations in exon 2 often result in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated dystrophin protein that is non-functional.\n\n2. **Exon 8**: Mutations in exon 8 are the second most common, making up about 10-15% of all DMD mutations. These mutations can also lead to a truncated dystrophin protein.\n\n3. **Exon 44-55**: This region, known as the hotspot for DMD mutations, accounts for about 50-60% of all DMD cases. The majority of mutations in this region are deletions, but duplications and point mutations also occur.\n\n4. **Exon 13**: Mutations in exon 13 are less common, accounting for about 5% of all DMD mutations. These mutations can result in a variety of phenotypes, ranging from severe DMD to milder Becker muscular dystrophy.\n\nOther less common mutation locations include exons 3, 6, 9, 12, 17, 19, 43, 45, 46, 47, 51, 52, 53, 60, and 62. It's important to note that the severity of the disease can vary depending on the location and type of mutation in the dystrophin gene.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - Mutation Types: The most common type of mutation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a deletion of one or more exons. These deletions account for approximately 60-65% of all DMD cases. The most common regions for exon deletions are:\n\n* Exons 45-55 (Spectrin-like region): This region is the most commonly affected, accounting for about 40-45% of all DMD cases.\n* Exons 2-20: This region is the second most commonly affected, accounting for about 15-20% of all DMD cases.\n* Exons 44-52: This region is the third most commonly affected, accounting for about 10-15% of all DMD cases.\n\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - Mutation Types: Point mutations, which are changes in a single nucleotide, account for approximately 30-35% of all DMD cases. The most common types of point mutations are:\n\n* Nonsense mutations: These are mutations that introduce a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated dystrophin protein. They account for about 15-20% of all DMD cases.\n* Missense mutations: These are mutations that change a single amino acid in the dystrophin protein. They account for about 10-15% of all DMD cases.\n\n[15]\nsource: external, content: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - Mutation Types: Duplications, which are extra copies of one or more exons, account for approximately 5-10% of all DMD cases.

Document: The regulatory element that promotes RNA polymerase II binding and facilitates the unwinding of DNA prior to translation is called the promoter. Promoters are DNA sequences that direct the transcription of a particular gene. They are recognized by RNA polymerase II, which is the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA). In addition to RNA polymerase II, promoters also recruit other factors that aid in the initiation of transcription, including transcription factors and the transcription initiation complex. These factors help to unwind the DNA double helix, allowing RNA polymerase II to access the DNA template and begin transcription. Therefore, promoters play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by controlling the binding of RNA polymerase II and other factors required for transcription.\n\nNew Documents:\n[23]\nsource: external, content: The TATA box is a core promoter element that promotes RNA polymerase II binding and facilitates the unwinding of DNA prior to transcription.

TBP specifically binds to the minor groove of the TATA box, helping to position the transcription initiation complex at the correct location on the DNA template. In addition to promoting RNA polymerase II binding, the TATA box also facilitates the recruitment of other transcription factors and general transcription factors (GTFs) that are necessary for the initiation of transcription.

They are primarily secreted by the heart in response to increased wall stress, often due to volume overload or pressure overload. The main natriuretic peptides are:\n\n1. **Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)**: This is the first natriuretic peptide to be discovered. It's primarily produced by the atria of the heart and helps to regulate blood pressure by promoting natriuresis (excretion of sodium in urine), diuresis (increased production of urine), and vasodilation (widening of blood vessels).\n\n2. **Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)**: BNP is secreted mainly by the ventricles of the heart, particularly in response to increased wall stress. It shares many of the same actions as ANP, including promoting natriuresis, diuresis, and vasodilation. BNP is also used clinically as a biomarker for heart failure.\n\n3. **C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP)**: CNP is the least studied of the natriuretic peptides. It's produced in various tissues throughout the body, including the brain, kidneys, and vascular endothelium. Unlike ANP and BNP, CNP doesn't seem to have a significant role in regulating blood pressure or fluid balance. Instead, it's thought to play a role in cell differentiation and growth.\n\nThese peptides act by binding to specific receptors on the surface of target cells, triggering a cascade of intracellular

Document: Zanubrutinib, marketed under the brand name Brukinsa, is a medication used to treat certain types of cancer. It is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor, which means it blocks the activity of an enzyme called Btk. This prevents certain cells from growing and dividing, which can help to slow or stop the spread of cancer.\n\nIn the United States, Zanubrutinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the following clinical applications:\n\n1. **Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)**: Zanubrutinib is approved for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. MCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system.\n\n2. **Relapsed or Refractory Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM)**: Zanubrutinib is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and produces an abnormal protein called macroglobulin.\n\n3. **Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) in Relapse or Refractory**: In addition, Zanubrutinib is approved for the treatment of adult patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy. MZL is another type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nThese approvals are based on clinical trials that demonstrated Zanubrutinib's safety and efficacy in these specific patient populations. However, it's important to note that Zanubrutinib may be prescribed for other uses not listed here, as long as the prescribing healthcare provider has judged that the potential benefits to the patient outweigh any potential risks.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, these are the approved clinical applications of Zanubrutinib in the United States. For the most up-to-date information, I recommend checking the FDA's website or consulting with a healthcare provider.\n\n[1]\nsource: external, content: FDA approves zanubrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia or ...: FDA approves zanubrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma | FDA          Skip to main content Skip to FDA Search Skip to in this section menu Skip to footer links           An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know        The.\n\n[2]\nsource: external, content: FDA Approves Tablet Formulation of Zanubrutinib for All Indications: 1 Zanubrutinib, a second-generation BTK inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma.\n\n[3]\nsource: external, content: BRUKINSA® (zanubrutinib) BTK Inhibitor | For Patients: BRUKINSA® (zanubrutinib) BTK Inhibitor | For Patients                                                       US HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS   US PATIENTS & CAREGIVERS   Patient Information Important Safety Information Prescribing Information myBeOneSupport™       Menu          Patient Information   Important Safety Information   Prescribing Information    US healthcare providers                                                          CLEARLY BRUKINSA to help you take control     BRUKINSA is a targeted oral therapy used to treat adults living with:   CLL/SLL Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma   WM Waldenström'sMacroglobulinemia   MCL Previously TreatedMantle Cell Lymphoma   MZL Previously TreatedMarginal Zone Lymphoma   FL Previously TreatedFollicular Lymphoma            BRUKINSA is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with:  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL).\n\n[4]\nsource: external, content: Tablet formulation of zanubrutinib granted approval by the EC for all ...: On June 11, 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the tablet formulation of zanubrutinib for all U.S.-approved indications ...\n\n[5]\nsource: external, content: FDA Approves Zanubrutinib for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or ...: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved zanubrutinib (Brukinsa®) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or ...\n\n[6]\nsource: external, content: Brukinsa Now FDA Approved for Patients with CLL or SLL: Zanubrutinib was previously approved for mantle-cell lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, and relapsed or refractory marginal-zone lymphoma.\n\n[7]\nsource: external, content: Zanubrut", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Pre-mRNA Processing: Pre-mRNA processing is a critical step in gene expression that occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It involves several key steps that transform a newly transcribed pre-mRNA into a mature mRNA that can be translated into a protein. Here's a summary of the key steps:\n\n1. **5' Capping**: The first step in pre-mRNA processing is the addition of a 'cap' to the 5' end of the pre-mRNA. This cap is composed of a 7-methylguanosine residue linked to the first nucleotide of the mRNA via a 5'-5' triphosphate bridge. Capping helps protect the mRNA from degradation and aids in its translation.\n\n2. **Splicing**: The next step is splicing, where introns (non-coding sequences) are removed and exons (coding sequences) are joined together. This process can be complex, as it involves alternative splicing, where different exons can be joined in different ways to create different protein isoforms. Splicing is facilitated by small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other proteins.\n\n3. **3' End Formation**: The final step in pre-mRNA processing is the formation of the 3' end of the mRNA. This involves two processes: cleavage and polyadenylation. Cleavage removes the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and adds a poly-A tail, which helps stabilize the mRNA and facilitates its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation.\n\n4. **Export**: After these processing steps, the mature mRNA is ready for export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This is facilitated by proteins like CRM1 and RanBP1.\n\n5. **Translation**: Once in the cytoplasm, the mature mRNA can be translated into a protein by the ribosome. This is the final step in gene expression.\n\nThese steps are crucial for the production of functional mRNAs that can be translated into proteins. Any disruption in these processes can lead to genetic disorders or cancer.\n\n[13]\nsource: external, content: Pre-mRNA Processing: Pre-mRNA processing is a critical step in gene expression that occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.

Document: Non-pharmacological measures are crucial in managing procedural pain in neonates, especially in situations where pharmacological interventions are not feasible or preferred. Here are some currently used non-pharmacological measures:\n\n1. **Sucrose (Sweet Solution)**: Administering a sweet solution, such as 24% oral sucrose, before a painful procedure can help reduce the neonate's response to pain. It's important to note that while sucrose is considered non-pharmacological, it does have a physiological effect on the neonate's response to pain.\n\n2. **Non-Nutritive Sucking (NNS)**: Providing a pacifier or allowing the neonate to suck on their fist can help reduce pain responses. This is thought to stimulate the release of endogenous opioids, which are natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.\n\n3. **Skin-to-Skin Contact (SSC)**: Also known as kangaroo care, SSC involves placing the neonate in direct skin-to-skin contact with their parent. This can help reduce stress and pain responses in the neonate.\n\n4. **Distraction**: Using visual or auditory stimuli to distract the neonate from the procedure can help reduce their perception of pain. This could include playing music, showing them a mobile, or using other visual stimuli.\n\n5. **Positioning**: Proper positioning of the neonate during a procedure can help reduce discomfort. For example, placing the neonate in a lateral position with their knees flexed can help reduce pain during heel lance procedures.\n\n6. **Comfort Measures**: These include swaddling, providing warmth, and minimizing noise and light. These measures can help create a calming environment for the neonate, reducing their overall stress and pain response.\n\nWhile these measures can be helpful, it's important to remember that no single measure is effective in all situations. A combination of these strategies is often used to manage procedural pain in neonates. Always consult with a healthcare provider for advice tailored to a specific neonate's needs.\n\nI don’t know: I don’t have information about any specific guidelines or policies regarding the use of these measures in specific healthcare facilities or regions. I also don’t know the exact effectiveness of these measures in every situation, as individual responses to pain can vary greatly among neonates.\nResponse: Based on the provided information, the currently used non-pharmacological measures for the management of procedural pain in neonates include:\n\n1. **Sucrose (Sweet Solution)**: Administering a sweet solution, such as 24% oral sucrose, before a painful procedure can help reduce the neonate's response to pain.

Document: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe form of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects males. It's caused by a mutation in the DMD gene, which encodes for dystrophin, a protein crucial for muscle function. DMD is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, starting in the legs and pelvis, and often leading to wheelchair dependence by the late teens. Here are some gene therapies currently under investigation for DMD:\n\n1. **Exon Skipping**: This approach aims to bypass the mutated exon (gene segment) in the DMD gene, allowing the remaining gene to produce a functional dystrophin protein. Several exon-skipping therapies are in clinical trials, targeting different exons. Some examples include:\n   - **SRP-5001**: Targets exon 51, currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials.\n   - **SRP-4053**: Targets exon 53, also in Phase 1/2 trials.\n   - **Viltepotide**: Targets exon 53, completed Phase 2b trials and is now in Phase 3.\n\n2. **Gene Replacement**: This strategy involves delivering a functional copy of the DMD gene to muscle cells. While promising, this approach faces challenges due to the large size of the DMD gene. One example is:\n   - **Microdystrophin**: A smaller, functional version of the dystrophin gene delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV). It's currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials.\n\n3. **Stop Codon Readthrough**: This method uses drugs to bypass a premature stop codon caused by a mutation, allowing the production of functional dystrophin. An example is:\n   - **Ataluren**: Currently in Phase 2/3 clinical trials.\n\n4. **Gene Editing**: Technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 are being explored to correct the DMD gene mutation directly in muscle cells. While promising, this approach is still in early stages of research.\n\nI don’t know: While these therapies show promise, it's important to note that clinical trials are ongoing, and their long-term efficacy and safety are not yet fully established. Additionally, I don’t know the specific details of any upcoming trials or the current status of those mentioned here, as this information can change rapidly.\nAnswer: Based on the provided information, several gene therapies are under investigation for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Document: Alternative microexon splicing by RBFOX2 and PTBP1 is associated with various diseases and biological processes. RBFOX2, also known as RBM9, is a member of the RBFOX family of RNA-binding proteins that play a crucial role in alternative splicing. It is involved in the regulation of microexon splicing, which are small exons (26-54 nucleotides) that are often conserved across species. RBFOX2 has been found to be associated with several diseases, including:\n\n1. **Cancer**: RBFOX2 has been shown to be upregulated in certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer and glioblastoma, and its knockdown can inhibit cancer cell growth and migration. It is thought to contribute to cancer progression by regulating the splicing of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.\n\n2. **Neurodevelopmental disorders**: RBFOX2 is highly expressed in the brain and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in RBFOX2 have been identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. These mutations can affect RBFOX2's RNA-binding activity, leading to abnormal splicing of its target genes and potentially contributing to the development of these disorders.\n\nPTBP1, or polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1, is another RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing. It has been shown to interact with RBFOX2 and cooperate with it in regulating microexon splicing. PTBP1 has also been associated with various diseases, including:\n\n1. **Cancer**: Similar to RBFOX2, PTBP1 has been found to be dysregulated in certain types of cancer. It can promote cancer progression by regulating the splicing of genes involved in cell growth, survival, and metastasis.\n\n2. **Neurological disorders**: PTBP1 has been implicated in neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in PTBP1 have been identified in individuals with these disorders, and it is thought that these mutations can affect PTBP1's RNA-binding activity and lead to abnormal splicing of its target genes.\n\nIn summary, alternative microexon splicing by RBFOX2 and PTBP1 is associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. Their roles in these diseases are thought to be mediated through their regulation of alternative splicing, which can affect the expression and function of numerous genes. However, it is important to note that the specific mechanisms by which RBFOX2 and PTBP", "[12]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[13]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[14]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[15]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[16]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[17]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[18]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[19]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[20]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[21]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[22]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[23]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[24]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[25]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[26]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[27]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[28]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[29]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[30]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[31]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[32]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[33]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[34]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[35]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[36]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[37]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[38]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[39]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[40]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[41]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[42]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[43]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[44]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[45]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[46]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[47]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[48]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.\n[49]\nsource: internal, content: Concizumab is used for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with", "[12]\nsource: external, content: Glucocorticoids for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that are commonly used in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

While many women may not experience any symptoms, others can have a range of symptoms depending on the size, location, and number of fibroids. Here are some of the most common symptoms:\n\n1. **Heavy or Prolonged Menstrual Periods**: Fibroids can cause heavier than normal menstrual bleeding, or bleeding that lasts longer than usual. This can lead to anemia if not managed properly.\n\n2. **Pain or Pressure in the Pelvic Area**: As fibroids grow, they can cause pressure or pain in the pelvic area. This can feel like a dull ache or sharp pain, and may be constant or intermittent.\n\n3. **Abdominal Swelling or Bloating**: Large fibroids can cause the abdomen to swell or feel bloated. This can also lead to a change in bowel or bladder habits.\n\n4. **Infertility or Miscarriage**: While not common, fibroids can sometimes cause infertility or increase the risk of miscarriage. They can also cause problems during pregnancy, such as premature labor or low birth weight.\n\n5. **Pain During Intercourse**: In some cases, fibroids can cause pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse.\n\n6. **Fatigue**: Due to the heavy menstrual periods and potential anemia, women with fibroids may feel more tired than usual.\n\nIf you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider.

Here's a summary of the most effective immunotherapy regimens for MSI-H CRC:\n\n1. **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs)**: ICIs are the most effective and commonly used immunotherapies for MSI-H CRC. They work by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, which helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.\n\n   - **Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)**: Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) advanced CRC. It's typically given as a single agent at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.\n\n   - **Nivolumab (Opdivo)**: Nivolumab is another PD-1 inhibitor that can be used in combination with another immunotherapy, ipilimumab (Yervoy), for the treatment of MSI-H CRC. The recommended dose is 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for nivolumab and 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks for ipilimumab.\n\n2. **Combination Immunotherapy**: Combining different immunotherapies can sometimes lead to better outcomes. For example, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has shown promising results in clinical trials.\n\n3. **Adoptive Cell Transfer (ACT)**: ACT involves collecting and modifying a patient's own immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. This approach is still being investigated in clinical trials, but it shows potential for MSI-H CRC.\n\nIn conclusion, the most effective immunotherapy regimens for patients with MSI-H advanced CRC are immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly pembrolizumab as a single agent or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. However, it's important to note that individual responses to immunotherapy can vary, and treatment decisions should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.\n\nI don’t know: While immunotherapy has shown significant promise in MSI-H CRC, there are still many unanswered questions about the most effective regimens, optimal dosing, and potential combinations with other therapies. Ongoing clinical trials are working to answer these questions and improve patient outcomes.\nLast Context: [12]", "[1]\nsource: external, content: The first human monkeypox was identified in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and since then cases have been increasingly reported across regions in central and west Africa where it became endemic in such areas [2].\n\n[2]\nsource: external, content: Mpox - World Health Organization (WHO): The first reported human case of mpox was a nine-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1970).\n\n[3]\nsource: external, content: Mpox – NFID: The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during a period of intensified effort to eliminate smallpox.\n\n[4]\nsource: external, content: Mpox has a long history – it was first discovered in 1958 ... - Facebook: Mpox formerly known as monkeypox has been known since 195-eight.

CRC screening is recommended for adults aged 50 to 75 years, but uptake remains suboptimal.

CRC screening is recommended for adults aged 50 to 75 years, but uptake remains suboptimal. This systematic review aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different CRC screening strategies, including fecal immunochemical test (FIT), sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy, in the general population.\n\n[14]\nsource: external, content: Cost-Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review: ResultsThe results of this systematic review suggest that FIT-based screening is the most cost-effective strategy for CRC screening in the general population. FIT is a non-invasive, convenient, and inexpensive test that can be performed at home. When positive, FIT can be followed by colonoscopy to confirm the presence of CRC or advanced adenomas. Compared to other screening strategies, FIT-based screening has a lower cost per life-year saved and a higher quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.\n\n[15]\nsource: external, content: Cost-Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review: ConclusionsThe findings of this systematic review suggest that FIT-based screening is the most cost-effective strategy for CRC screening in the general population.

Document: According to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is the most cost-effective method for colorectal cancer screening in the general population. The study compared the costs and benefits of different screening methods, including FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. FOBT was found to be the most cost-effective, with a cost per life-year saved of $12,000, compared to $20,000 for sigmoidoscopy and $30,000 for colonoscopy. However, it's important to note that while FOBT is the most cost-effective, it is not the most sensitive or specific test. Therefore, the choice of screening method may depend on individual patient preferences and risk factors. I don’t know the specific details of the study or the exact costs, but this is the general consensus based on the available evidence.\n\n[17]\nsource: internal, content: Colorectal cancer screening methods: Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is the most cost-effective for general population.
